      "book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in\n",
      "it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or\n",
      "conversation?'\n",
      "\n",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\n",
      "hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure\n",
      "of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n",
      "picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\n",
      "close by her.\n",

      "Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it\n",
      "occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time\n",
      "it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH\n",
      "OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,\n",
      "Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had\n",
      "never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch\n",
      "to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field\n",
      "after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large\n",
      "rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\n",
      "in the world she was to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\n",
      "dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\n",
      "about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep\n",
      "well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n",
      "plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was\n",
      "going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what\n",
      "she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\n",
      "hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as\n",
      "she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great\n",
      "disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\n",
      "of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as\n",
      "she fell past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall\n",
      "think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at\n",
      "home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top\n",
      "of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how\n",
      "many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting\n",
      "somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four\n",
      "thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several\n",
      "things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this\n",
      "was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there\n",
      "was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)\n",
      "'--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\n",
      "or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or\n",
      "Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the\n",
      "earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with\n",
      "their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad\n",
      "there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the\n",
      "right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country\n",
      "is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and\n",
      "she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\n",
      "through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an\n",
      "ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to\n",
      "ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\n",
      "talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'\n",
      "(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at\n",
      "tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no\n",
      "mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very\n",
      "like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice\n",
      "began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy\n",
      "sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do\n",
      "bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,\n",
      "it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing\n",
      "off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with\n",
      "Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:\n",
      "did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon\n",
      "a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\n",
      "she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\n",
      "long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.\n",
      "There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and\n",
      "was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears\n",
      "and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she\n",
      "turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\n",
      "from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\n",
      "Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\n",
      "door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\n",
      "get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\n",
      "into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\n",
      "that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\n",
      "those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\n",
      "doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it\n",
      "would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could\n",
      "shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.'\n",
      "For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,\n",
      "that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really\n",
      "impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n",
      "back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\n",
      "any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\n",
      "time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here\n",
      "before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\n",
      "label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large\n",
      "letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was\n",
      "not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and\n",
      "see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read several nice\n",
      "little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild\n",
      "beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember\n",
      "the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot\n",
      "poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\n",
      "finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never\n",
      "forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is\n",
      "almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste\n",
      "it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour\n",
      "of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot\n",
      "buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n",

      "telescope.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\n",
      "brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\n",
      "through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\n",
      "waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\n",
      "she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said\n",

      "what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a\n",

      "ever having seen such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\n",
      "into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\n",
      "door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\n",
      "went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\n",
      "it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\n",
      "best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\n",
      "and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\n",
      "sat down and cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself,\n",
      "rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally\n",
      "gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\n",
      "and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\n",
      "her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\n",
      "cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\n",
      "for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n",
      "'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!\n",
      "Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\n",
      "she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n",
      "'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said\n",
      "Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\n",
      "makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll\n",
      "get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which\n",
      "way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\n",
      "growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\n",
      "size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\n",
      "had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\n",
      "things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on\n",
      "in the common way.\n",

      "\n",
      "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!\n",
      "she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she\n",
      "had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by\n",
      "railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\n",
      "her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\n",
      "to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\n",
      "sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\n",
      "of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon\n",
      "made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she\n",
      "was nine feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying\n",
      "to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\n",

      "However, everything is queer to-day.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\n",
      "off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\n",
      "it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\n",
      "she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\n",
      "slipped in like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?\n",
      "Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\n",
      "likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she\n",
      "began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\n",
      "of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right\n",
      "way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\n",
      "she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of\n",
      "a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather\n",
      "inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\n",
      "but it said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's\n",
      "a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all\n",
      "her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\n",
      "anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which\n",
      "was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\n",
      "sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.\n",
      "'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt\n",
      "the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would\n",
      "YOU like cats if you were me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry\n",
      "about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd\n",
      "take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet\n",
      "thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the\n",
      "pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and\n",
      "washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's\n",
      "such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried\n",
      "Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she\n",
      "felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any\n",
      "more if you'd rather not.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\n",
      "tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED\n",
      "cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\n",
      "conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not\n",
      "answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near\n",
      "our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\n",
      "know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when\n",
      "you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\n",
      "of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,\n",
      "you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He\n",
      "says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful\n",
      "tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming\n",
      "away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\n",
      "the pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\n",
      "won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the\n",
      "Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its\n",
      "face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\n",
      "trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my\n",
      "history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\n",
      "birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,\n",
      "a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the\n",
      "way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n",
      "\n",
      "They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the\n",
      "birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\n",
      "to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\n",
      "consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural\n",
      "to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had\n",
      "known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the\n",
      "Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than\n",
      "you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without\n",
      "knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its\n",
      "age, there was no more to be said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\n",
      "called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you\n",
      "dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse\n",
      "in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt\n",
      "sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This\n",
      "is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \"William\n",
      "the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\n",
      "to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\n",

      "\n",
      "'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.\n",

      "you speak?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. \"Edwin and Morcar,\n",
      "the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,\n",
      "the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what\n",
      "\"it\" means.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I know what \"it\" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the\n",
      "Duck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\n",

      "\n",
      "The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '\"--found\n",
      "it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the\n",
      "crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his\n",
      "Normans--\" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning\n",
      "to Alice as it spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to\n",
      "dry me at all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move\n",
      "that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\n",
      "remedies--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half\n",
      "those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And\n",
      "the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\n",
      "tittered audibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that\n",
      "the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,\n",
      "but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,\n",
      "and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as\n",
      "you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell\n",
      "you how the Dodo managed it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact\n",
      "shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed\n",
      "along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and\n",
      "away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\n",
      "liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\n",
      "when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,\n",
      "the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded\n",
      "round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'\n",
      "\n",
      "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,\n",
      "and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead\n",
      "(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures\n",
      "of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,\n",
      "'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;\n",
      "and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused\n",
      "way, 'Prizes! Prizes!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\n",
      "pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\n",
      "not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one\n",
      "a-piece all round.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in\n",
      "your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\n",
      "presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant\n",
      "thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\n",
      "that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\n",
      "to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\n",
      "confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\n",
      "theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\n",
      "However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\n",
      "begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why\n",
      "it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\n",
      "would be offended again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\n",
      "sighing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at\n",
      "the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling\n",
      "about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was\n",
      "something like this:--\n",

      "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\n",
      "anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\n",
      "it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\n",
      "my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\n",
      "ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a\n",
      "moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,\n",
      "and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\n",
      "nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in\n",
      "the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,\n",
      "had vanished completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\n",
      "called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing\n",
      "out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!\n",
      "Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once\n",
      "in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it\n",
      "had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How\n",
      "surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him\n",
      "his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she\n",
      "came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\n",
      "plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without\n",
      "knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\n",
      "real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\n",
      "fan and gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for\n",
      "a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she\n",
      "began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '\"Miss Alice! Come\n",
      "here directly, and get ready for your walk!\" \"Coming in a minute,\n",
      "nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out.\" Only I don't\n",
      "think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it\n",

      "\n",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\n",
      "in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs\n",
      "of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,\n",
      "and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little\n",
      "bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time\n",
      "with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it\n",
      "to her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said\n",
      "to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what\n",
      "this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really\n",
      "I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'\n",
      "\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\n",
      "and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\n",
      "down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't\n",
      "grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't\n",
      "drunk quite so much!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I\n",
      "can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\n",
      "and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\n",
      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and\n",
      "yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n",
      "CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that\n",
      "kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!\n",
      "There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I\n",
      "grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful\n",
      "tone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am\n",
      "now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but\n",
      "then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn\n",
      "lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all\n",
      "for any lesson-books!'\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making\n",
      "quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard\n",
      "a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!'\n",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\n",
      "the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large\n",
      "as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\n",
      "the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And\n",
      "then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging\n",
      "for apples, yer honour!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and\n",
      "help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')\n",
      "\n",
      "'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\n",
      "window!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\n",
      "now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at\n",
      "all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n",
      "TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of\n",
      "cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do\n",
      "next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm\n",
      "sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices\n",
      "all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other\n",
      "ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em\n",
      "together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll\n",
      "do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this\n",
      "rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming\n",
      "down! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I\n",
      "fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I\n",
      "won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to\n",
      "go down the chimney!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to\n",
      "herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in\n",
      "Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\n",
      "I THINK I can kick a little!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited\n",
      "till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)\n",
      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\n",
      "saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to\n",
      "see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!'\n",
      "then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy\n",
      "now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\n",
      "us all about it!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought\n",
      "Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm\n",
      "a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me\n",
      "like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'So you did, old fellow!' said the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called\n",
      "out as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I\n",
      "wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the\n",
      "roof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,'\n",
      "she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!'\n",
      "which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make\n",
      "SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must\n",
      "make me smaller, I suppose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\n",
      "the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\n",
      "animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was\n",
      "in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered\n",
      "about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second\n",
      "thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be\n",
      "the best plan.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'\n",
      "said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\n",
      "she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\n",
      "hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\n",
      "all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and\n",
      "till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that\n",
      "I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I\n",
      "suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\n",
      "question is, what?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\n",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\n",
      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\n",
      "was on the top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\n",
      "mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,\n",
      "that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long\n",
      "hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.\n",

      "at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed\n",
      "her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\n",
      "rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know\n",

      "\n",

      "different sizes in a day is very confusing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you\n",
      "have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then\n",
      "after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little\n",
      "queer, won't you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",

      "is, it would feel very queer to ME.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\n",
      "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY\n",
      "short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,\n",
      "you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\n",
      "good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant\n",

      "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and\n",
      "perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some\n",
      "minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its\n",

      "just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going\n",
      "to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops\n",
      "of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made\n",
      "her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and\n",

      "Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I\n",

      "'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--'\n",

      "the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\n",
      "contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE\n",
      "with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use\n",
      "denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an\n",
      "egg!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful\n",
      "child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\n",
      "know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're\n",
      "a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\n",
      "minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're\n",
      "looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me\n",
      "whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking\n",
      "for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't\n",
      "like them raw.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\n",
      "down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as\n",
      "she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\n",
      "every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she\n",
      "remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\n",
      "she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\n",
      "other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\n",
      "succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\n",
      "felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\n",
      "and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done\n",
      "now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going\n",
      "to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right\n",
      "size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that\n",
      "to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open\n",
      "place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives\n",
      "there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,\n",
      "I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the\n",
      "righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she\n",
      "had brought herself down to nine inches high.\n",

      "CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper\n",
      "\n",
      "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\n",
      "to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\n",
      "wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\n",
      "otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\n",
      "fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened\n",
      "by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\n",
      "frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all\n",
      "over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,\n",
      "and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\n",
      "nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\n",
      "saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen\n",
      "to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,\n",
      "only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An\n",
      "invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the\n",
      "wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\n",
      "Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\n",
      "door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for\n",
      "two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you\n",
      "are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise\n",
      "going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then\n",
      "a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on\n",
      "without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance,\n",
      "if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'\n",
      "He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this\n",
      "Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she\n",
      "said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.\n",
      "But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she\n",
      "repeated, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,\n",
      "and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\n",
      "as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first\n",
      "question, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really\n",
      "dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.\n",
      "It's enough to drive one crazy!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\n",
      "remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for\n",
      "days and days.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But what am I to do?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's\n",
      "perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\n",
      "one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in\n",
      "the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring\n",
      "a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,\n",
      "as well as she could for sneezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess\n",
      "sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\n",
      "alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen\n",
      "that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on\n",
      "the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\n",
      "not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why\n",
      "your cat grins like that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\n",
      "jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,\n",
      "and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know\n",
      "that cats COULD grin.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite\n",
      "pleased to have got into a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\n",
      "be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\n",
      "was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\n",
      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in\n",
      "an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually\n",
      "large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse\n",
      "growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get\n",
      "an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of\n",
      "what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes\n",
      "twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\n",
      "the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\n",
      "be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is\n",
      "it twelve? I--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'\n",
      "And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of\n",
      "lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of\n",
      "every line:\n",
      "\n",
      "   'Speak roughly to your little boy,\n",
      "    And beat him when he sneezes:\n",

      "\n",
      "While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\n",
      "the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\n",
      "that Alice could hardly hear the words:--\n",
      "\n",
      "   'I speak severely to my boy,\n",
      "    I beat him when he sneezes;\n",

      "\n",
      "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\n",
      "little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just\n",

      "ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried\n",
      "it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'\n",
      "thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be\n",
      "murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the\n",
      "little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n",
      "'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing\n",
      "yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to\n",
      "see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\n",
      "a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its\n",
      "eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not\n",
      "like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,'\n",
      "she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'\n",
      "said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\n",
      "now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\n",
      "to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with\n",
      "this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently,\n",
      "that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could\n",
      "be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she\n",
      "felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see\n",
      "it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said\n",
      "to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\n",
      "rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other\n",
      "children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\n",
      "to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she\n",
      "was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a\n",
      "tree a few yards off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\n",
      "thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she\n",
      "felt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\n",
      "whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.\n",
      "'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you\n",
      "tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't much care where--' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long\n",
      "enough.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.\n",
      "'What sort of people live about here?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives\n",
      "a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March\n",
      "Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.\n",
      "You're mad.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how\n",
      "do you know that you're mad?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I suppose so,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,\n",
      "and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and\n",
      "wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the\n",
      "Queen to-day?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited\n",
      "yet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\n",
      "things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\n",
      "it suddenly appeared again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly\n",
      "forgotten to ask.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\n",
      "in a natural way.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\n",
      "appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\n",
      "which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she\n",
      "said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\n",
      "perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as\n",
      "it was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\n",
      "again, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and\n",
      "vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\n",
      "beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\n",
      "remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin\n",
      "without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house\n",
      "of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\n",
      "chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\n",
      "was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\n",
      "nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to\n",
      "about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,\n",
      "saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost\n",

      "CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\n",
      "March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\n",
      "between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\n",
      "cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very\n",
      "uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I\n",
      "suppose it doesn't mind.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\n",
      "one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice\n",
      "coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat\n",
      "down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n",
      "'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said\n",
      "the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great\n",
      "many more than three.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice\n",
      "for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some\n",
      "severity; 'it's very rude.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID\n",
      "was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've\n",
      "begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the\n",
      "March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Exactly so,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I\n",
      "say--that's the same thing, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say\n",
      "that \"I see what I eat\" is the same thing as \"I eat what I see\"!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that \"I like what I\n",
      "get\" is the same thing as \"I get what I like\"!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\n",
      "talking in his sleep, 'that \"I breathe when I sleep\" is the same thing\n",
      "as \"I sleep when I breathe\"!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the\n",
      "conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice\n",
      "thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,\n",
      "which wasn't much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month\n",
      "is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\n",
      "pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\n",
      "and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit\n",
      "the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:\n",
      "'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\n",
      "it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\n",
      "nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,\n",
      "you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a\n",
      "funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't\n",
      "tell what o'clock it is!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you what\n",
      "year it is?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it\n",
      "stays the same year for such a long time together.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no\n",
      "sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite\n",
      "understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little\n",
      "hot tea upon its nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\n",
      "eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nor I,' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the\n",
      "time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk\n",
      "about wasting IT. It's HIM.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.\n",
      "'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time\n",
      "when I learn music.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating.\n",
      "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything\n",
      "you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in\n",
      "the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a\n",
      "hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\n",
      "time for dinner!'\n",
      "\n",
      "('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n",
      "\n",
      "'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I\n",
      "shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to\n",
      "half-past one as long as you liked.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We\n",
      "quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing\n",
      "with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert\n",
      "given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\n",
      "     How I wonder what you're at!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You know the song, perhaps?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Up above the world you fly,\n",
      "     Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n",
      "         Twinkle, twinkle--\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle,\n",
      "twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch\n",
      "it to make it stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the\n",
      "Queen jumped up and bawled out, \"He's murdering the time! Off with his\n",
      "head!\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't\n",
      "do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so many\n",
      "tea-things are put out here?' she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time,\n",
      "and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured\n",
      "to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n",
      "'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the\n",
      "proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And\n",
      "they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a\n",
      "hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again\n",
      "before it's done.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began\n",
      "in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\n",
      "they lived at the bottom of a well--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in\n",
      "questions of eating and drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\n",
      "two.\n",
      "\n",
      "'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd\n",
      "have been ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\n",
      "living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But\n",
      "why did they live at the bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't\n",
      "take more.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take\n",
      "MORE than nothing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself\n",
      "to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\n",
      "repeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\n",
      "said, 'It was a treacle-well.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\n",
      "Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily\n",
      "remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for\n",
      "yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I\n",
      "dare say there may be ONE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\n",
      "go on. 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,\n",
      "you know--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place\n",
      "on.'\n",

      "the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\n",
      "jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented\n",
      "with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among\n",
      "them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried\n",
      "nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\n",

      "a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their\n",

      "\n",

      "faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the\n",

      "silent.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large\n",

      "'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\n",
      "wondering very much what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was\n",

      "\n",
      "'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\n",
      "anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\n",
      "tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under\n",
      "sentence of execution.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What for?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Did you say \"What a pity!\"?' the Rabbit asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said\n",
      "\"What for?\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\n",
      "scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\n",
      "tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\n",
      "Queen said--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\n",
      "people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\n",
      "other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\n",
      "began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in\n",
      "her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,\n",
      "the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves\n",
      "up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\n",
      "she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under\n",
      "her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got\n",
      "its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a\n",
      "blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,\n",
      "with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\n",
      "laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin\n",
      "again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\n",
      "itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was\n",
      "generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the\n",
      "hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up\n",
      "and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the\n",
      "conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\n",
      "all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short\n",
      "time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\n",
      "shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a\n",
      "minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\n",
      "dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n",
      "'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully\n",
      "fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one\n",
      "left alive!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\n",
      "could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance\n",
      "in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it\n",
      "a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself\n",
      "'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\n",
      "enough for it to speak with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use\n",
      "speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one\n",
      "of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\n",
      "down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\n",
      "she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was\n",
      "enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a\n",
      "complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear\n",
      "oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;\n",
      "at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how\n",
      "confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the\n",
      "arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\n",
      "ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only\n",
      "it ran away when it saw mine coming!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed\n",
      "that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n",
      "'--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking\n",
      "at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to\n",
      "introduce it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may\n",
      "kiss my hand if it likes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'\n",
      "He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book,\n",
      "but I don't remember where.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called\n",
      "the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would\n",
      "have this cat removed!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.\n",
      "'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he\n",
      "hurried off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\n",
      "on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with\n",
      "passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\n",
      "executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\n",
      "of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\n",
      "whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\n",
      "to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\n",
      "other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the\n",
      "other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless\n",
      "sort of way to fly up into a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\n",
      "was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't\n",
      "matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side\n",
      "of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\n",
      "escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a\n",
      "large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\n",
      "the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\n",
      "while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\n",
      "the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\n",
      "all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\n",
      "what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless\n",
      "there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\n",
      "thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be\n",
      "beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less\n",
      "than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last\n",

      "And the executioner went off like an arrow.\n",

      " The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\n",
      "by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely\n",

      "She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\n",
      "startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking\n",
      "about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't\n",
      "tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\n",
      "a bit.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only\n",
      "you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as\n",
      "she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\n",
      "Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\n",
      "right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an\n",
      "uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\n",
      "bore it as well as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up\n",
      "the conversation a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--\"Oh, 'tis love,\n",
      "'tis love, that makes the world go round!\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding\n",
      "their own business!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her\n",
      "sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral\n",
      "of THAT is--\"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\n",
      "themselves.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,'\n",
      "the Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about\n",
      "the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to\n",
      "have the experiment tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\n",
      "the moral of that is--\"Birds of a feather flock together.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of\n",
      "putting things!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\n",
      "everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And\n",
      "the moral of that is--\"The more there is of mine, the less there is of\n",
      "yours.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,\n",
      "'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that\n",
      "is--\"Be what you would seem to be\"--or if you'd like it put more\n",
      "simply--\"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\n",
      "appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise\n",
      "than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\"'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in\n",
      "a pleased tone.\n",

      "'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said\n",
      "Alice.\n",
      "\n",

      "of everything I've said as yet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give\n",
      "birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to say it out\n",
      "loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\n",
      "little chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\n",
      "feel a little worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and\n",
      "the m--'\n",
      "\n",
      "But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even\n",
      "in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked\n",
      "into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen\n",
      "in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the\n",
      "ground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that in\n",
      "about half no time! Take your choice!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was\n",
      "too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\n",
      "croquet-ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were\n",
      "resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\n",
      "back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would\n",
      "cost them their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with\n",
      "the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her\n",
      "head!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,\n",
      "who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by\n",
      "the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the\n",
      "players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and\n",
      "under sentence of execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have\n",
      "you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\n",
      "to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good\n",
      "thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\n",
      "number of executions the Queen had ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.\n",
      "(IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy\n",
      "thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock\n",
      "Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\n",
      "executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with\n",
      "the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on\n",
      "the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go\n",
      "after that savage Queen: so she waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\n",
      "she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,\n",
      "half to itself, half to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What IS the fun?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never\n",
      "executes nobody, you know. Come on!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly\n",
      "after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\n",
      "sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\n",
      "nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\n",
      "pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the\n",
      "Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his\n",
      "fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\n",
      "full of tears, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your\n",
      "history, she do.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit\n",
      "down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But\n",
      "she waited patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real\n",
      "Turtle.'\n",
      "\n",
      "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\n",
      "occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant\n",
      "heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\n",
      "saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could\n",
      "not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\n",
      "though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the\n",
      "sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle\n",
      "angrily: 'really you are very dull!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'\n",
      "added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor\n",
      "Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said\n",
      "to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'\n",
      "and he went on in these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\n",
      "The Mock Turtle went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud\n",
      "as all that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in\n",
      "a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,\n",
      "\"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of\n",
      "the sea.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I\n",
      "only took the regular course.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What was that?' inquired Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle\n",
      "replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,\n",
      "Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never heard of \"Uglification,\"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of\n",
      "uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,\n",
      "you ARE a simpleton.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she\n",
      "turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off\n",
      "the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with\n",
      "Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\n",
      "that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\n",
      "Fainting in Coils.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What was THAT like?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too\n",
      "stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.\n",
      "He was an old crab, HE was.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught\n",
      "Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\n",
      "creatures hid their faces in their paws.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to\n",
      "change the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so\n",
      "on.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked:\n",
      "'because they lessen from day to day.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\n",
      "before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a\n",
      "holiday?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided\n",

      "CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\n",
      "his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\n",
      "two sobs choked his voice. 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,'\n",
      "said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\n",
      "the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\n",
      "running down his cheeks, he went on again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said\n",
      "Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'\n",
      "(Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and\n",
      "said 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\n",
      "Lobster Quadrille is!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the\n",
      "sea-shore--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\n",
      "then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'--you advance twice--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "'--as far out to sea as you can--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock\n",
      "Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been\n",
      "jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly\n",
      "and quietly, and looked at Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Very much indeed,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",

      "'We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. 'I've forgotten the words.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\n",
      "then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\n",
      "forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\n",
      "and sadly:--\n",
      "\n",
      " '\"Will you walk a little faster?\" said a whiting to a snail.\n",
      " \"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.\n",

      " \"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\n",
      " When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\"\n",
      " But the snail replied \"Too far, too far!\" and gave a look askance--\n",
      " Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\n",
      "\n",
      " Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\n",
      " Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\n",
      "\n",
      " '\"What matters it how far we go?\" his scaly friend replied.\n",
      " \"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling\n",

      "their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all\n",
      "wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the\n",
      "reason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her\n",
      "about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters\n",
      "to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long\n",
      "way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get\n",
      "them out again. That's all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much\n",
      "about a whiting before.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you\n",
      "know why it's called a whiting?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated\n",
      "in a wondering tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what\n",
      "makes them so shiny?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\n",
      "answer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n",
      "'are done with a whiting. Now you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n",
      "'any shrimp could have told you that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running\n",
      "on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, \"Keep back, please: we\n",
      "don't want YOU with us!\"'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and\n",
      "told me he was going a journey, I should say \"With what porpoise?\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't you mean \"purpose\"?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\n",
      "the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said\n",
      "Alice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday,\n",

      "\n",

      "'explanations take such a dreadful time.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\n",
      "saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\n",
      "the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\n",
      "their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went\n",
      "on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about\n",
      "her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the\n",
      "words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,\n",

      "\n",
      "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\n",
      "arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little\n",
      "birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\n",
      "standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\n",
      "him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,\n",
      "and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court\n",
      "was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,\n",
      "that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the\n",
      "trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there\n",
      "seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about\n",
      "her, to pass away the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\n",
      "about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\n",
      "the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to\n",
      "herself, 'because of his great wig.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\n",
      "wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did\n",
      "not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'\n",
      "(she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were\n",
      "animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said\n",
      "this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of\n",
      "it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her\n",
      "age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done\n",
      "just as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they\n",
      "doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put\n",
      "down yet, before the trial's begun.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for\n",
      "fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped\n",
      "hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the\n",
      "King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who\n",
      "was talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\n",
      "that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,\n",
      "and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell\n",
      "'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice\n",
      "muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\n",
      "could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\n",
      "very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\n",
      "that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\n",
      "at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was\n",
      "obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was\n",
      "of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\n",
      "unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--\n",
      "\n",
      "   'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n",
      "      All on a summer day:\n",
      "    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n",
      "      And took them quite away!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great\n",
      "deal to come before that!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three\n",
      "blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one\n",
      "hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your\n",
      "Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished\n",
      "my tea when I was sent for.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\n",
      "court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it\n",
      "was,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\n",
      "wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\n",
      "reduced the answer to shillings and pence.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a\n",
      "memorandum of the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of\n",
      "my own. I'm a hatter.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\n",
      "who turned pale and fidgeted.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have\n",
      "you executed on the spot.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\n",
      "from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in\n",
      "his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\n",
      "bread-and-butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\n",
      "her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\n",
      "grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\n",
      "the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as\n",
      "long as there was room for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting\n",
      "next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing\n",
      "too.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that\n",
      "ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\n",
      "other side of the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\n",
      "just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\n",
      "of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on\n",
      "which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you\n",
      "executed, whether you're nervous or not.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n",
      "'--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the\n",
      "bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you\n",
      "take me for a dunce? Go on!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after\n",
      "that--only the March Hare said--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You did!' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I deny it!' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking\n",
      "anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\n",
      "nothing, being fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\n",
      "down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.\n",

      "'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\n",
      "the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\n",
      "explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\n",
      "up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\n",
      "head first, and then sat upon it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read\n",
      "in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some attempts\n",

      "court,\" and I never understood what it meant till now.'\n",

      "\n",
      "Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n",

      "on better.'\n",
      "\n",

      "Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\n",

      "of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had\n",
      "finished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream,\n",
      "dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So\n",
      "Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\n",
      "what a wonderful dream it had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\n",
      "hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her\n",
      "wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and\n",
      "this was her dream:--\n",
      "\n",
      "First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\n",
      "hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking\n",
      "up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that\n",
      "queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that\n",
      "WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to\n",
      "listen, the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of\n",
      "her little sister's dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the\n",
      "frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she\n",
      "could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\n",
      "shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\n",
      "ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby\n",
      "was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed\n",
      "around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\n",
      "Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\n",
      "filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\n",
      "Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\n",
      "Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\n",
      "would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the\n",
      "wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling\n",
      "teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill\n",
      "cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the\n",
      "shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she\n",
      "knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing\n",
      "of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's\n",
      "heavy sobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\n",

      "keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\n",
      "childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and\n",
      "make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even\n",
      "with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with\n",
      "all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\n",

      "Alien from Heaven, with passions foul obscured: \n",
      "Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade \n",
      "Lost sight of him:  One of the banished crew, \n",

      "Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, \n",
      "Or undiminished brightness to be known, \n",
      "As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure; \n",

      "The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage; \n",
      "But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on, \n",
      "Champing his iron curb:  To strive or fly \n",
      "He held it vain; awe from above had quelled \n",
      "His heart, not else dismayed.  Now drew they nigh \n",
      "The western point, where those half-rounding guards \n",
      "Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined, \n",
      "A waiting next command.  To whom their Chief, \n",
      "Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud. \n",
      "O friends!  I hear the tread of nimble feet \n",
      "Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern \n",
      "Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade; \n",
      "And with them comes a third of regal port, \n",
      "But faded splendour wan; who by his gait \n",
      "And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, \n",
      "Not likely to part hence without contest; \n",
      "Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. \n",
      "He scarce had ended, when those two approached, \n",
      "And brief related whom they brought, where found, \n",
      "How busied, in what form and posture couched. \n",
      "To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. \n",
      "Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed \n",
      "To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge \n",
      "Of others, who approve not to transgress \n",
      "By thy example, but have power and right \n",
      "To question thy bold entrance on this place; \n",
      "Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those \n",
      "Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss! \n",
      "To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow. \n",
      "Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise, \n",
      "And such I held thee; but this question asked \n",
      "Puts me in doubt.  Lives there who loves his pain! \n",
      "Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, \n",
      "Though thither doomed!  Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt \n",
      "And boldly venture to whatever place \n",
      "Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change \n",
      "Torment with ease, and soonest recompense \n",
      "Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; \n",
      "To thee no reason, who knowest only good, \n",
      "But evil hast not tried: and wilt object \n",
      "His will who bounds us!  Let him surer bar \n",
      "His iron gates, if he intends our stay \n",
      "In that dark durance:  Thus much what was asked. \n",
      "The rest is true, they found me where they say; \n",
      "But that implies not violence or harm. \n",
      "Thus he in scorn.  The warlike Angel moved, \n",
      "Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied. \n",
      "O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise \n",
      "Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew, \n",
      "And now returns him from his prison 'scaped, \n",
      "Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise \n",
      "Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither \n",
      "Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed; \n",
      "So wise he judges it to fly from pain \n",
      "However, and to 'scape his punishment! \n",
      "So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath, \n",
      "Which thou incurrest by flying, meet thy flight \n",
      "Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, \n",
      "Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain \n",
      "Can equal anger infinite provoked. \n",
      "But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee \n",
      "Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they \n",
      "Less hardy to endure?  Courageous Chief! \n",
      "The first in flight from pain! hadst thou alleged \n",
      "To thy deserted host this cause of flight, \n",
      "Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. \n",
      "To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern. \n",
      "Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, \n",
      "Insulting Angel! well thou knowest I stood \n",
      "Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid \n",
      "The blasting vollied thunder made all speed, \n",
      "And seconded thy else not dreaded spear. \n",
      "But still thy words at random, as before, \n",
      "Argue thy inexperience what behoves \n",
      "From hard assays and ill successes past \n",
      "A faithful leader, not to hazard all \n",
      "Through ways of danger by himself untried: \n",
      "I, therefore, I alone first undertook \n",
      "To wing the desolate abyss, and spy \n",
      "This new created world, whereof in Hell \n",
      "Fame is not silent, here in hope to find \n",
      "Better abode, and my afflicted Powers \n",
      "To settle here on earth, or in mid air; \n",
      "Though for possession put to try once more \n",
      "What thou and thy gay legions dare against; \n",
      "Whose easier business were to serve their Lord \n",
      "High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne, \n",
      "And practised distances to cringe, not fight, \n",
      "To whom the warriour Angel soon replied. \n",
      "To say and straight unsay, pretending first \n",
      "Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy, \n",
      "Argues no leader but a liear traced, \n",
      "Satan, and couldst thou faithful add?  O name, \n",
      "O sacred name of faithfulness profaned! \n",
      "Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? \n",
      "Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head. \n",
      "Was this your discipline and faith engaged, \n",
      "Your military obedience, to dissolve \n",
      "Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme? \n",
      "And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem \n",
      "Patron of liberty, who more than thou \n",
      "Once fawned, and cringed, and servily adored \n",
      "Heaven's awful Monarch? wherefore, but in hope \n",
      "To dispossess him, and thyself to reign? \n",
      "But mark what I arreed thee now, Avant; \n",
      "Fly neither whence thou fledst!  If from this hour \n",
      "Within these hallowed limits thou appear, \n",
      "Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained, \n",

      "The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred. \n",
      "So threatened he; but Satan to no threats \n",
      "Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied. \n",
      "Then when I am thy captive talk of chains, \n",
      "Proud limitary Cherub! but ere then \n",
      "Far heavier load thyself expect to feel \n",
      "From my prevailing arm, though Heaven's King \n",
      "Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers, \n",
      "Us'd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels \n",
      "In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved. \n",
      "While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright \n",
      "Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns \n",
      "Their phalanx, and began to hem him round \n",
      "With ported spears, as thick as when a field \n",
      "Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends \n",
      "Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind \n",
      "Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands, \n",
      "Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves \n",
      "Prove chaff.  On the other side, Satan, alarmed, \n",
      "Collecting all his might, dilated stood, \n",
      "Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved: \n",
      "His stature reached the sky, and on his crest \n",
      "Sat Horrour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp \n",
      "What seemed both spear and shield:  Now dreadful deeds \n",
      "Might have ensued, nor only Paradise \n",
      "In this commotion, but the starry cope \n",
      "Of Heaven perhaps, or all the elements \n",

      "With violence of this conflict, had not soon \n",
      "The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray, \n",

      "Battles and realms:  In these he put two weights, \n",
      "The sequel each of parting and of fight: \n",
      "The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam, \n",
      "Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. \n",
      "Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine; \n",
      "Neither our own, but given:  What folly then \n",
      "To boast what arms can do? since thine no more \n",
      "Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now \n",

      "And read thy lot in yon celestial sign; \n",
      "Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak, \n",
      "If thou resist.  The Fiend looked up, and knew \n",

      "Celestial equipage; and now came forth \n",

      "Far into Chaos, and the world unborn; \n",
      "For Chaos heard his voice:  Him all his train \n",

      "Creation, and the wonders of his might. \n",
      "Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand \n",
      "He took the golden compasses, prepared \n",
      "In God's eternal store, to circumscribe \n",
      "This universe, and all created things: \n",
      "One foot he centered, and the other turned \n",
      "Round through the vast profundity obscure; \n",

      "The black tartareous cold infernal dregs, \n",
      "Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed \n",
      "Like things to like; the rest to several place \n",
      "Disparted, and between spun out the air; \n",

      "Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure, \n",
      "Sprung from the deep; and from her native east \n",
      "To journey through the aery gloom began, \n",
      "Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun \n",
      "Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle \n",
      "Sojourned the while.  God saw the light was good; \n",
      "And light from darkness by the hemisphere \n",
      "Divided: light the Day, and darkness Night, \n",
      "He named.  Thus was the first day even and morn: \n",
      "Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung \n",
      "By the celestial quires, when orient light \n",
      "Exhaling first from darkness they beheld; \n",
      "Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout \n",
      "The hollow universal orb they filled, \n",

      "Again, God said,  Let there be firmament \n",
      "Amid the waters, and let it divide \n",
      "The waters from the waters; and God made \n",
      "The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, \n",
      "Transparent, elemental air, diffused \n",
      "In circuit to the uttermost convex \n",
      "Of this great round; partition firm and sure, \n",

      "Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule \n",
      "Of Chaos far removed; lest fierce extremes \n",
      "Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: \n",
      "And Heaven he named the Firmament:  So even \n",
      "And morning chorus sung the second day. \n",
      "The Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet \n",
      "Of waters, embryon immature involved, \n",
      "Appeared not: over all the face of Earth \n",
      "Main ocean flowed, not idle; but, with warm \n",

      "Into one place, and let dry land appear. \n",
      "Immediately the mountains huge appear \n",
      "Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave \n",
      "Into the clouds; their tops ascend the sky: \n",
      "So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low \n",
      "Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, \n",
      "Capacious bed of waters:  Thither they \n",
      "Hasted with glad precipitance, uprolled, \n",
      "As drops on dust conglobing from the dry: \n",
      "Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct, \n",
      "For haste; such flight the great command impressed \n",
      "On the swift floods:  As armies at the call \n",
      "Of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard) \n",
      "Troop to their standard; so the watery throng, \n",
      "Wave rolling after wave, where way they found, \n",
      "If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain, \n",
      "Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill; \n",
      "But they, or under ground, or circuit wide \n",
      "With serpent errour wandering, found their way, \n",
      "And on the washy oose deep channels wore; \n",
      "Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry, \n",
      "All but within those banks, where rivers now \n",
      "Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train. \n",
      "The dry land, Earth; and the great receptacle \n",
      "Of congregated waters, he called Seas: \n",
      "And saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth \n",

      "Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth. \n",
      "He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then \n",
      "Desart and bare, unsightly, unadorned, \n",
      "Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad \n",
      "Her universal face with pleasant green; \n",
      "Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered \n",
      "Opening their various colours, and made gay \n",
      "Her bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown, \n",
      "Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept \n",
      "The swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed \n",
      "Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub, \n",
      "And bush with frizzled hair implicit:  Last \n",
      "Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread \n",
      "Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed \n",
      "Their blossoms:  With high woods the hills were crowned; \n",
      "With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side; \n",
      "With borders long the rivers: that Earth now \n",
      "Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell, \n",
      "Or wander with delight, and love to haunt \n",
      "Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained \n",
      "Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground \n",
      "None was; but from the Earth a dewy mist \n",
      "Went up, and watered all the ground, and each \n",
      "Plant of the field; which, ere it was in the Earth, \n",
      "God made, and every herb, before it grew \n",
      "On the green stem:  God saw that it was good: \n",
      "So even and morn recorded the third day. \n",
      "Again the Almighty spake, Let there be lights \n",
      "High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide \n",
      "The day from night; and let them be for signs, \n",
      "For seasons, and for days, and circling years; \n",
      "And let them be for lights, as I ordain \n",
      "Their office in the firmament of Heaven, \n",
      "To give light on the Earth; and it was so. \n",
      "And God made two great lights, great for their use \n",
      "To Man, the greater to have rule by day, \n",
      "The less by night, altern; and made the stars, \n",
      "And set them in the firmament of Heaven \n",
      "To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day \n",
      "In their vicissitude, and rule the night, \n",
      "And light from darkness to divide.  God saw, \n",
      "Surveying his great work, that it was good: \n",
      "For of celestial bodies first the sun \n",
      "A mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first, \n",
      "Though of ethereal mould: then formed the moon \n",
      "Globose, and every magnitude of stars, \n",
      "And sowed with stars the Heaven, thick as a field: \n",
      "Of light by far the greater part he took, \n",
      "Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed \n",
      "In the sun's orb, made porous to receive \n",
      "And drink the liquid light; firm to retain \n",
      "Her gathered beams, great palace now of light. \n",
      "Hither, as to their fountain, other stars \n",
      "Repairing, in their golden urns draw light, \n",
      "And hence the morning-planet gilds her horns; \n",
      "By tincture or reflection they augment \n",
      "Their small peculiar, though from human sight \n",
      "So far remote, with diminution seen, \n",
      "First in his east the glorious lamp was seen, \n",
      "Regent of day, and all the horizon round \n",
      "Invested with bright rays, jocund to run \n",
      "His longitude through Heaven's high road; the gray \n",
      "Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced, \n",
      "Shedding sweet influence:  Less bright the moon, \n",
      "But opposite in levelled west was set, \n",
      "His mirrour, with full face borrowing her light \n",
      "From him; for other light she needed none \n",
      "In that aspect, and still that distance keeps \n",
      "Till night; then in the east her turn she shines, \n",
      "Revolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign \n",
      "With thousand lesser lights dividual holds, \n",
      "With thousand thousand stars, that then appeared \n",
      "Spangling the hemisphere:  Then first adorned \n",
      "With their bright luminaries that set and rose, \n",
      "Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day. \n",
      "And God said, Let the waters generate \n",
      "Reptile with spawn abundant, living soul: \n",
      "And let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings \n",
      "Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven. \n",
      "And God created the great whales, and each \n",
      "Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously \n",

      "Be fruitful, multiply, and in the seas, \n",
      "And lakes, and running streams, the waters fill; \n",
      "And let the fowl be multiplied, on the Earth. \n",
      "Forthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay, \n",
      "With fry innumerable swarm, and shoals \n",
      "Of fish that with their fins, and shining scales, \n",
      "Glide under the green wave, in sculls that oft \n",
      "Bank the mid sea: part single, or with mate, \n",
      "Graze the sea-weed their pasture, and through groves \n",
      "Of coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance, \n",
      "Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold; \n",
      "Or, in their pearly shells at ease, attend \n",
      "Moist nutriment; or under rocks their food \n",
      "In jointed armour watch: on smooth the seal \n",
      "And bended dolphins play: part huge of bulk \n",
      "Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait, \n",
      "Tempest the ocean: there leviathan, \n",
      "Hugest of living creatures, on the deep \n",

      "Their brood as numerous hatch, from the egg that soon \n",
      "Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed \n",
      "Their callow young; but feathered soon and fledge \n",
      "They summed their pens; and, soaring the air sublime, \n",
      "With clang despised the ground, under a cloud \n",
      "In prospect; there the eagle and the stork \n",

      "In common, ranged in figure, wedge their way, \n",

      "From branch to branch the smaller birds with song \n",
      "Solaced the woods, and spread their painted wings \n",
      "Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale \n",
      "Ceased warbling, but all night tun'd her soft lays: \n",
      "Others, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed \n",
      "Their downy breast; the swan with arched neck, \n",
      "Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows \n",
      "Her state with oary feet; yet oft they quit \n",
      "The dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower \n",
      "The mid aereal sky:  Others on ground \n",

      "The silent hours, and the other whose gay train \n",
      "Adorns him, coloured with the florid hue \n",
      "Of rainbows and starry eyes.  The waters thus \n",
      "With fish replenished, and the air with fowl, \n",
      "Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day. \n",
      "The sixth, and of creation last, arose \n",

      "Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind, \n",
      "Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth, \n",

      "The tawny lion, pawing to get free \n",
      "His hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds, \n",

      "Pattern of just equality perhaps \n",
      "Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes \n",
      "Of commonalty:  Swarming next appeared \n",
      "The female bee, that feeds her husband drone \n",
      "Deliciously, and builds her waxen cells \n",
      "With honey stored:  The rest are numberless, \n",
      "And thou their natures knowest, and gavest them names, \n",
      "Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown \n",

      "In Paradise, and various, yet unknown \n",
      "To us; in such abundance lies our choice, \n",
      "As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched, \n",
      "Still hanging incorruptible, till men \n",
      "Grow up to their provision, and more hands \n",
      "Help to disburden Nature of her birth. \n",
      "To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad. \n",
      "Empress, the way is ready, and not long; \n",

      "Law to ourselves; our reason is our law. \n",
      "To whom the Tempter guilefully replied. \n",

      "Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely and in act \n",
      "Raised, as of some great matter to begin. \n",

      "In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence \n",
      "Flourished, since mute! to some great cause addressed, \n",
      "Stood in himself collected; while each part, \n",
      "Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue; \n",
      "Sometimes in highth began, as no delay \n",
      "Of preface brooking, through his zeal of right: \n",
      "So standing, moving, or to highth up grown, \n",

      "Her doing seemed to justify the deed; \n",
      "She gave me of the tree, and I did eat. \n",

      "Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge \n",
      "Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied. \n",
      "The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat. \n",
      "Which when the Lord God heard, without delay \n",
      "To judgement he proceeded on the accused \n",
      "Serpent, though brute; unable to transfer \n",
      "The guilt on him, who made him instrument \n",
      "Of mischief, and polluted from the end \n",
      "Of his creation; justly then accursed, \n",
      "As vitiated in nature:  More to know \n",
      "Concerned not Man, (since he no further knew) \n",
      "Nor altered his offence; yet God at last \n",
      "To Satan first in sin his doom applied, \n",
      "Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best: \n",
      "And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. \n",
      "Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed \n",
      "Above all cattle, each beast of the field; \n",
      "Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go, \n",
      "And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life. \n",
      "Between thee and the woman I will put \n",
      "Enmity, and between thine and her seed; \n",
      "Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. \n",
      "So spake this oracle, then verified \n",
      "When Jesus, Son of Mary, second Eve, \n",
      "Saw Satan fall, like lightning, down from Heaven, \n",
      "Prince of the air; then, rising from his grave \n",
      "Spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed \n",
      "In open show; and, with ascension bright, \n",
      "Captivity led captive through the air, \n",
      "The realm itself of Satan, long usurped; \n",
      "Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; \n",
      "Even he, who now foretold his fatal bruise; \n",
      "And to the Woman thus his sentence turned. \n",
      "Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply \n",
      "By thy conception; children thou shalt bring \n",
      "In sorrow forth; and to thy husband's will \n",
      "Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule. \n",
      "On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced. \n",
      "Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, \n",
      "And eaten of the tree, concerning which \n",
      "I charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof: \n",
      "Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow \n",
      "Shalt eat thereof, all the days of thy life; \n",
      "Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth \n",
      "Unbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; \n",
      "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, \n",
      "Till thou return unto the ground; for thou \n",
      "Out of the ground wast taken, know thy birth, \n",
      "For dust thou art, and shalt to dust return. \n",
      "So judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent; \n",
      "And the instant stroke of death, denounced that day, \n",
      "Removed far off; then, pitying how they stood \n",
      "Before him naked to the air, that now \n",
      "Must suffer change, disdained not to begin \n",
      "Thenceforth the form of servant to assume; \n",
      "As when he washed his servants feet; so now, \n",
      "As father of his family, he clad \n",
      "Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain, \n",
      "Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid; \n",
      "And thought not much to clothe his enemies; \n",
      "Nor he their outward only with the skins \n",
      "Of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more. \n",
      "Opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness, \n",
      "Arraying, covered from his Father's sight. \n",
      "To him with swift ascent he up returned, \n",
      "Into his blissful bosom reassumed \n",
      "In glory, as of old; to him appeased \n",
      "All, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man \n",
      "Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. \n",
      "Mean while, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth, \n",
      "Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death, \n",
      "In counterview within the gates, that now \n",
      "Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame \n",
      "Far into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through, \n",
      "Sin opening; who thus now to Death began. \n",
      "O Son, why sit we here each other viewing \n",
      "Idly, while Satan, our great author, thrives \n",
      "In other worlds, and happier seat provides \n",
      "For us, his offspring dear?  It cannot be \n",
      "But that success attends him; if mishap, \n",
      "Ere this he had returned, with fury driven \n",
      "By his avengers; since no place like this \n",
      "Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. \n",
      "Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, \n",
      "Wings growing, and dominion given me large \n",
      "Beyond this deep; whatever draws me on, \n",
      "Or sympathy, or some connatural force, \n",
      "Powerful at greatest distance to unite, \n",
      "With secret amity, things of like kind, \n",
      "By secretest conveyance.  Thou, my shade \n",
      "Inseparable, must with me along; \n",
      "For Death from Sin no power can separate. \n",
      "But, lest the difficulty of passing back \n",
      "Stay his return perhaps over this gulf \n",
      "Impassable, impervious; let us try \n",
      "Adventurous work, yet to thy power and mine \n",
      "Not unagreeable, to found a path \n",
      "Over this main from Hell to that new world, \n",
      "Where Satan now prevails; a monument \n",
      "Of merit high to all the infernal host, \n",
      "Easing their passage hence, for intercourse, \n",
      "Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead. \n",
      "Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn \n",
      "By this new-felt attraction and instinct. \n",
      "Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon. \n",
      "Go, whither Fate, and inclination strong, \n",
      "Leads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err \n",
      "The way, thou leading; such a scent I draw \n",
      "Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste \n",
      "The savour of death from all things there that live: \n",
      "Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest \n",
      "Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. \n",
      "So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell \n",
      "Of mortal change on earth.  As when a flock \n",
      "Of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote, \n",
      "Against the day of battle, to a field, \n",
      "Where armies lie encamped, come flying, lured \n",
      "With scent of living carcasses designed \n",
      "For death, the following day, in bloody fight: \n",
      "So scented the grim Feature, and upturned \n",
      "His nostril wide into the murky air; \n",
      "Sagacious of his quarry from so far. \n",
      "Then both from out Hell-gates, into the waste \n",

      "Flew diverse; and with power (their power was great) \n",
      "Hovering upon the waters, what they met \n",
      "Solid or slimy, as in raging sea \n",
      "Tost up and down, together crouded drove, \n",
      "From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell; \n",

      "Death with his mace petrifick, cold and dry, \n",
      "As with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm \n",
      "As Delos, floating once; the rest his look \n",
      "Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move; \n",
      "And with Asphaltick slime, broad as the gate, \n",
      "Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach \n",
      "They fastened, and the mole immense wrought on \n",
      "Over the foaming deep high-arched, a bridge \n",
      "Of length prodigious, joining to the wall \n",
      "Immoveable of this now fenceless world, \n",
      "Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, \n",
      "Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell. \n",

      "Xerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke, \n",
      "From Susa, his Memnonian palace high, \n",
      "Came to the sea: and, over Hellespont \n",
      "Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined, \n",
      "And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves. \n",
      "Now had they brought the work by wonderous art \n",
      "Pontifical, a ridge of pendant rock, \n",
      "Over the vexed abyss, following the track \n",
      "Of Satan to the self-same place where he \n",
      "First lighted from his wing, and landed safe \n",
      "From out of Chaos, to the outside bare \n",
      "Of this round world:  With pins of adamant \n",
      "And chains they made all fast, too fast they made \n",
      "And durable!  And now in little space \n",
      "The confines met of empyrean Heaven, \n",
      "And of this World; and, on the left hand, Hell \n",
      "With long reach interposed; three several ways \n",
      "In sight, to each of these three places led. \n",

      "His zenith, while the sun in Aries rose: \n",
      "Disguised he came; but those his children dear \n",
      "Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise. \n",
      "He, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk \n",
      "Into the wood fast by; and, changing shape, \n",
      "To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act \n",
      "By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded \n",
      "Upon her husband; saw their shame that sought \n",
      "Vain covertures; but when he saw descend \n",
      "The Son of God to judge them, terrified \n",
      "He fled; not hoping to escape, but shun \n",
      "The present; fearing, guilty, what his wrath \n",
      "Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned \n",
      "By night, and listening where the hapless pair \n",
      "Sat in their sad discourse, and various plaint, \n",
      "Thence gathered his own doom; which understood \n",
      "Not instant, but of future time, with joy \n",
      "And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned; \n",
      "And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot \n",
      "Of this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped \n",
      "Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear. \n",
      "Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight \n",
      "Of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased. \n",

      "Enchanting daughter, thus the silence broke. \n",
      "O Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds, \n",
      "Thy trophies! which thou viewest as not thine own; \n",
      "Thou art their author, and prime architect: \n",
      "For I no sooner in my heart divined, \n",

      "Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! \n",

      "In his first shape on Man; but many shapes \n",
      "Of Death, and many are the ways that lead \n",
      "To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense \n",
      "More terrible at the entrance, than within. \n",
      "Some, as thou sawest, by violent stroke shall die; \n",
      "By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more \n",
      "In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall bring \n",

      "Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence, \n",
      "Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums. \n",
      "Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair \n",
      "Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch; \n",

      "Of cattle grazing; others, whence the sound \n",
      "Of instruments, that made melodious chime, \n",
      "Was heard, of harp and organ; and, who moved \n",
      "Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch, \n",
      "Instinct through all proportions, low and high, \n",
      "Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue. \n",
      "In other part stood one who, at the forge \n",
      "Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass \n",
      "Had melted, (whether found where casual fire \n",
      "Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale, \n",
      "Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot \n",
      "To some cave's mouth; or whether washed by stream \n",
      "From underground;) the liquid ore he drained \n",
      "Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed \n",
      "First his own tools; then, what might else be wrought \n",
      "Fusil or graven in metal.  After these, \n",
      "But on the hither side, a different sort \n",
      "From the high neighbouring hills, which was their seat, \n",
      "Down to the plain descended; by their guise \n",
      "Just men they seemed, and all their study bent \n",

      "Freedom and peace to Men; they on the plain \n",
      "Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold! \n",
      "A bevy of fair women, richly gay \n",
      "In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung \n",
      "Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on: \n",
      "The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes \n",
      "Rove without rein; till, in the amorous net \n",

      "And now of love they treat, till the evening-star, \n",
      "Love's harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat \n",
      "They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke \n",
      "Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked: \n",
      "With feast and musick all the tents resound. \n",
      "Such happy interview, and fair event \n",
      "Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers, \n",

      "By pleasure, though to nature seeming meet; \n",
      "Created, as thou art, to nobler end \n",
      "Holy and pure, conformity divine. \n",
      "Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were the tents \n",

      "Yet empty of all good wherein consists \n",
      "Woman's domestick honour and chief praise; \n",
      "Bred only and completed to the taste \n",
      "Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance, \n",

      "To these that sober race of men, whose lives \n",

      "Entered so fair, should turn aside to tread \n",
      "Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! \n",

      "From Man's effeminate slackness it begins, \n",
      "Said the Angel, who should better hold his place \n",
      "By wisdom, and superiour gifts received. \n",
      "But now prepare thee for another scene. \n",
      "He looked, and saw wide territory spread \n",
      "Before him, towns, and rural works between; \n",
      "Cities of men with lofty gates and towers, \n",
      "Concourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war, \n",

      "Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies \n",
      "With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field, \n",
      "Deserted:  Others to a city strong \n",
      "Lay siege, encamped; by battery, scale, and mine, \n",
      "Assaulting; others from the wall defend \n",
      "With dart and javelin, stones, and sulphurous fire; \n",
      "On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds. \n",

      "Produce prodigious births of body or mind. \n",
      "Such were these giants, men of high renown; \n",

      "The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar; \n",

      "Then, from the mountain hewing timber tall, \n",
      "Began to build a vessel of huge bulk; \n",
      "Measured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth; \n",

      "With their four wives; and God made fast the door. \n",
      "Mean while the south-wind rose, and, with black wings \n",

      "Nel frattempo è mio desiderio , come del resto mi è stato chiesto da alcuni colleghi , osservare un minuto di silenzio in memoria di tutte le vittime delle tempeste che si sono abbattute sui diversi paesi dell ' Unione europea .\n",
      "Vi invito pertanto ad alzarvi in piedi per osservare appunto un minuto di silenzio .\n",
      "( Il Parlamento osserva un minuto di silenzio ) Signora Presidente , intervengo per una mozione d' ordine .\n",
      "Come avrà letto sui giornali o sentito alla televisione , in Sri Lanka si sono verificati numerosi assassinii ed esplosioni di ordigni .\n",
      "Una delle vittime più recenti è stato Kumar Ponnambalam , che qualche mese fa era venuto in visita qui al Parlamento europeo .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , sarebbe opportuno che inviasse una lettera alla Presidente del Sri Lanka per esprimere le condoglianze del Parlamento per questa e le altre morti violente verificatesi in Sri Lanka e per invitarla a fare quanto in suo potere al fine di giungere a una riconciliazione pacifica in questa situazione assai difficile .\n",
      "Sì , onorevole Evans , ritengo che un ' iniziativa del tipo che lei propone sia assolutamente opportuna .\n",
      "Se l ' Assemblea è d ' accordo seguirò il suggerimento dell ' onorevole Evans .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , un richiamo al Regolamento .\n",
      "Gradirei avere il suo parere riguardo all' articolo 143 sull' inammissibilità .\n",
      "La mia domanda si ricollega a un tema all' ordine del giorno di giovedì e che formulerò di nuovo al momento opportuno .\n",
      "La relazione Cunha sui programmi di orientamento pluriennali è iscritta all' ordine del giorno della Plenaria di giovedì e al paragrafo 6 contiene una proposta volta a introdurre una sorta di sanzione a carico delle quote di quei paesi che non riescono a raggiungere i loro obiettivi di riduzione annuali delle flotte , nonostante il principio della stabilità relativa .\n",
      "Credo che tale principio sia un principio giuridico fondamentale della politica comune della pesca e qualsiasi proposta volta a sovvertirlo sarebbe giuridicamente inammissibile Vorrei sapere se è possibile sollevare un' obiezione di questo tipo nel contesto di una semplice relazione , e non di una proposta legislativa , e se rientra nelle mie competenze sollevare una tale obiezione giovedì prossimo .\n",
      "E ' appunto in quell ' occasione che , se lo desidera , avrà modo di sollevare la sua questione pregiudiziale , cioè giovedì in apertura della discussione sulla relazione .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , in coincidenza con la prima tornata dell' anno del Parlamento europeo , negli Stati Uniti in Texas è stata fissata , purtroppo per giovedì prossimo , l' esecuzione di un condannato a morte , un giovane di 34 anni che chiameremo di nome Hicks .\n",
      "Su richiesta di un deputato francese , l' onorevole Zimeray , è già stata presentata una petizione , che ha avuto molti firmatari tra cui il sottoscritto , ma le chiedo , in conformità con l' indirizzo ormai costantemente espresso dal Parlamento europeo e da tutta la Comunità europea , di intervenire , con il prestigio della sua carica e dell' Istituzione che lei rappresenta , presso il Presidente e il Governatore del Texas Bush , che ha il potere di sospendere la condanna a morte e di graziare il condannato .\n",
      "E tutto ciò in conformità con i principi che abbiamo sempre sostenuto .\n",
      "La ringrazio , onorevole Segni , lo farò volentieri .\n",
      "In effetti ciò è assolutamente conforme alla posizione che il nostro Parlamento ha sempre sostenuto .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , vorrei richiamare l' attenzione su un caso che il Parlamento segue da tempo , ossia il caso di Alexander Nikitin .\n",
      "Noi tutti siamo lieti che il tribunale lo abbia assolto , ribadendo che anche in Russia l' accesso a informazioni sull' ambiente è un diritto sancito dalla costituzione .\n",
      "Ora , però , verrà messo nuovamente in stato di accusa perché il pubblico ministero ricorrerà in appello .\n",
      "Come sappiamo e come abbiamo fatto rilevare in innumerevoli risoluzioni - anche nell' ultima seduta plenaria dell' anno scorso - non si tratta semplicemente di un caso giudiziario ed è un grave errore accusare Alexander Nikitin di aver commesso reati e atti criminali , tanto più che noi , in quanto diretti interessati , abbiamo beneficiato dei risultati delle sue ricerche .\n",
      "Tali risultati sono alla base dei programmi europei di tutela del Mare di Barents .\n",
      "La prego pertanto di prendere in esame la bozza della lettera in cui vengono indicati i fatti principali e di sostenere presso le autorità russe la posizione assunta dal Parlamento , conformemente alle sue risoluzioni .\n",
      "Sì , onorevole Scroedter , esaminerò volentieri i fatti relativi alla questione da lei esposta non appena avrò ricevuto la sua lettera .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , mi permetta di farle innanzi tutto i miei complimenti per aver tenuto fede alla parola data .\n",
      "In effetti il numero di canali televisivi disponibili nei nostri uffici è aumentato enormemente in questa prima tornata dell' anno nuovo .\n",
      "Tuttavia , signora Presidente , non è ancora stato dato seguito alla mia richiesta .\n",
      "E ' vero che adesso abbiamo due canali finlandesi e uno portoghese , ma purtroppo manca ancora il canale olandese .\n",
      "Ed era proprio quello che avevo chiesto , dato che noi parlamentari olandesi , quando veniamo spediti in questo esilio mensile , gradiremmo poter vedere il telegiornale in olandese .\n",
      "Ripeto ancora una volta la mia richiesta : faccia in modo che sia reso disponibile anche un canale olandese .\n",
      "Onorevole Plooj-van Gorsel , posso risponderle che tale punto figura all ' ordine del giorno della riunione dei questori di mercoledì .\n",
      "Spero che sarà esaminata con uno spirito positivo .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , vorrei sapere perché questo Parlamento non rispetta le norme in materia di salute e sicurezza che esso stesso approva .\n",
      "Perché non è stato condotto alcun test della qualità dell' aria in questo edificio da quando siamo stati eletti ?\n",
      "Perché dal 1998 il comitato salute e sicurezza non si è più riunito ?\n",
      "Perché non sono state fatte prove dell' allarme antincendio né negli edifici del Parlamento di Bruxelles né qui a Strasburgo ?\n",
      "Perché non esistono istruzioni da seguire in caso di incendio ?\n",
      "Perché dopo il mio incidente non sono state apportate migliorie alle scale ?\n",
      "Perché non viene fatto rispettare il divieto di fumare nelle aree riservate appunto ai non fumatori ?\n",
      "E ' assolutamente vergognoso che proprio noi non rispettiamo le norme da noi stessi approvate .\n",
      "Onorevole Lynne , lei ha perfettamente ragione e intendo verificare se tutto quanto lei ha detto davvero non è stato fatto .\n",
      "Intendo altresì sottoporre il punto al collegio dei questori e sono certa che ai nostri questori starà a cuore fare in modo che il Parlamento osservi le disposizioni che approva .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , l ' onorevole Díez González e io avevamo presentato alcune interrogazioni in merito a determinate opinioni della Vicepresidente de Palacio riferite da un giornale spagnolo .\n",
      "I servizi competenti non le hanno inserite all ' ordine del giorno , in quanto hanno ritenuto che avessero già ottenuto risposta in una tornata precedente .\n",
      "Chiedo che venga riesaminata tale decisione , in quanto non è così .\n",
      "Le interrogazioni cui è stata data risposta in precedenza riguardavano un intervento della Commissario de Palacio in un caso determinato , non le dichiarazioni pubblicate dal giornale ABC il 18 novembre scorso .\n",
      "Onorevole collega , sarà mia cura verificare tale punto .\n",
      "Devo confessarle che in questo momento la questione mi pare un po ' confusa .\n",
      "Quindi verificheremo con estrema attenzione per essere certi che tutto sia corretto .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , gradirei sapere se questa settimana il Parlamento intende lanciare un segnale chiaro per esprimere il nostro scontento riguardo alla decisione presa oggi di rifiutare il rinnovo dell' embargo sulle armi contro l ' Indonesia , visto e considerato che in passato la stragrande maggioranza dei deputati aveva sostenuto l' imposizione dell' embargo all' Indonesia .\n",
      "La decisione odierna di non rinnovarlo è pericolosissima , data la situazione sul posto .\n",
      "Il Parlamento dovrebbe pertanto inviare un messaggio , come auspica la stragrande maggioranza dei deputati .\n",
      "Gli Stati membri dell' Unione sono stati irresponsabili a non rinnovare l' embargo .\n",
      "Com' è già stato detto , la situazione in Indonesia è davvero esplosiva , con un forte rischio che in futuro si verifichi un colpo di Stato .\n",
      "Non sappiamo cosa stia succedendo e quindi mi chiedo perché si debba permettere ai produttori di armi dell' UE di trarne profitto a scapito di persone innocenti .\n",
      "Comunque sia , questo punto non è previsto nelle discussioni sui problemi di attualità di giovedì .\n",
      " \n",
      "Ordine dei lavori L ' ordine del giorno reca la fissazione dell ' ordine dei lavori .\n",
      "E ' stata distribuita la versione definitiva del progetto di ordine del giorno , elaborata , ai sensi dell ' articolo 110 del Regolamento , dalla Conferenza dei presidenti nella seduta di giovedì 13 gennaio .\n",
      "Non sono state proposte modifiche per lunedì e martedì .\n",
      "Mercoledì : Il gruppo PSE ha chiesto di iscrivere una dichiarazione della Commissione sui suoi obiettivi strategici per i prossimi cinque anni e sulla riforma amministrativa della Commissione .\n",
      "Desidero che l ' onorevole Barn Crespo , autore della richiesta , intervenga per motivarla , ovviamente se lo desidera .\n",
      "Poi procederemo come di norma : sentiremo un oratore a favore e uno contro .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , l ' idea che la Commissione Prodi presentasse il suo programma politico per tutta la legislatura proviene inizialmente da una proposta del gruppo del Partito del socialismo europeo , approvata all ' unanimità dalla Conferenza dei Presidenti in settembre e anche accettata esplicitamente dal Presidente Prodi , che ha ribadito il suo impegno al riguardo durante il discorso di investitura .\n",
      "Si tratta di un impegno importante in quanto la Commissione è un organo che detiene il monopolio di iniziativa , conformemente ai Trattati , e di conseguenza delinea i tratti essenziali di quella che sarà l ' attività politica e legislativa di questo Parlamento nei prossimi cinque anni .\n",
      "Ricordo altresì , signora Presidente , che durante la precedente legislatura il Parlamento ha votato due volte la fiducia a favore del Presidente Prodi ; durante l ' attuale legislatura l ' ha votata di nuovo a luglio e poi , dopo l ' insediamento della nuova Commissione , ha votato nuovamente la fiducia per l ' intera Commissione in settembre .\n",
      "Quindi c ' è già stato tempo a sufficienza per permettere alla Commissione di elaborare il suo programma e per consentirci di prenderne conoscenza per poi spiegarlo ai cittadini .\n",
      "A tale proposito ricordo la risoluzione del 15 settembre scorso , in cui si raccomandava di presentare la proposta il più rapidamente possibile .\n",
      "I fatti della settimana scorsa - scaturiti a latere della Conferenza dei Presidenti , sfruttata solo per corroborare e ratificare decisioni adottate al di fuori di essa - ci pongono di fronte a un dilemma : o la Commissione non è in grado di presentare questo programma ( in tal caso , sarebbe opportuno che lo dicesse .\n",
      "A sentire il suo Presidente , è in grado di farlo .\n",
      "Dato che la Commissione è rappresentata dalla vicepresidente de Palacio , ritengo che prima di votare converrebbe sapere se la Commissione è sempre disposta a presentare il programma , conformemente agli accordi ) ; oppure il Parlamento non è in grado di esaminare tale programma , come apparentemente sostengono alcuni .\n",
      "Secondo me , questa seconda ipotesi significherebbe rinunciare alle nostre responsabilità di Parlamento , oltre a introdurre una tesi originale , un metodo finora sconosciuto che consiste nel distribuire per iscritto ai gruppi politici il discorso programmatico della Commissione una settimana prima - e non il giorno prima , come era stato concordato .\n",
      "Considerando che il programma legislativo sarà discusso a febbraio , potremmo prescindere dal dibattito , in quanto il giorno dopo la stampa ed Internet avrebbero divulgato il testo a tutti i cittadini e quindi il Parlamento non avrebbe più bisogno di occuparsene .\n",
      "Secondo il mio gruppo , un Parlamento serve per ascoltare , discutere e riflettere , quindi a nostro avviso non c ' è alcuna ragione che giustifichi questo rinvio .\n",
      "Se la Commissione è in grado di presentare il programma , secondo noi siamo perfettamente in tempo per ripristinare l ' accordo iniziale intervenuto tra il Parlamento e la Commissione e comportarci responsabilmente dinnanzi ai nostri concittadini .\n",
      "Perciò la proposta del gruppo del Partito del socialismo europeo , da lei menzionata , è che mercoledì si mantenga la presentazione del programma per la legislatura della Commissione Prodi , inserendovi anche il progetto di riforma amministrativa .\n",
      "Altrimenti potremmo ritrovarci in una situazione paradossale : con la scusa che non c ' è il testo , si nega da un lato il diritto del Presidente della Commissione di rivolgersi a questo Parlamento , e dall ' altro che abbia luogo una discussione sulla riforma , senza che il Parlamento conosca a priori i testi su cui si basa .\n",
      "Pertanto , signora Presidente , la prego di chiedere alla Commissione di esprimersi subito e poi di procedere al voto .\n",
      "( Applausi dai banchi del gruppo del partito del socialismo europeo ) Signora Presidente , onorevoli colleghi , sono piuttosto sorpreso del comportamento del collega , onorevole Barón Crespo , che ora pretende che il punto in questione venga inserito nell' ordine del giorno di mercoledì .\n",
      "Onorevole collega Barón Crespo , lei non ha potuto partecipare giovedì scorso alla Conferenza dei presidenti .\n",
      "Non la biasimo per questo : può sempre succedere che si debba essere sostituiti .\n",
      "Il collega Hänsch è intervenuto in sua vece .\n",
      "In sede di Conferenza dei presidenti ne abbiamo discusso approfonditamente .\n",
      "Soltanto un gruppo politico condivideva l' opinione da lei espressa in questa sede .\n",
      "La questione è stata posta ai voti .\n",
      "Come è noto , ciascun presidente dispone di un numero di voti pari al numero dei deputati iscritti al proprio gruppo politico .\n",
      "Il punto in questione è stato oggetto di una votazione in cui , se ben ricordo , vi sono stati 422 voti contrari e 180 a favore con poche astensioni .\n",
      "Ciò significa che tutti i gruppi politici , ad eccezione dei non iscritti - che però non costituiscono un gruppo politico - , erano concordi e che un solo gruppo era del parere di procedere come proposto dal collega in questa sede .\n",
      "Tutti gli altri erano di diversa opinione e così è stato deciso .\n",
      "Vorrei ora entrare brevemente nel merito .\n",
      "Abbiamo fiducia nella Commissione , in Romano Prodi e la grande maggioranza del nostro gruppo politico , come tutti sanno , dopo un difficile processo ha votato la fiducia a Romano Prodi e alla Commissione .\n",
      "Tuttavia siamo anche dell' idea che la strategia della Commissione vada discussa nel corso di una procedura regolare , non soltanto in base a una dichiarazione rilasciata oralmente in questo Parlamento ma anche in base a un documento adottato dalla Commissione che illustri tale programma per i prossimi cinque anni .\n",
      "Ma un tale documento non esiste ancora !\n",
      "La Commissione presenterà il programma per il 2000 in febbraio .\n",
      "Abbiamo acconsentito : se la Commissione non vuole discutere il programma 2000 in gennaio lo faremo in febbraio .\n",
      "Non è certo nostra intenzione entrare in conflitto con la Commissione .\n",
      "Al contrario , pensiamo che per quanto possibile la Commissione e il Parlamento debbano percorrere una strada comune .\n",
      "Il Parlamento , tuttavia , esercita anche funzioni di controllo nei confronti della Commissione e non tutto ciò che viene proposto da quest' ultima deve necessariamente trovarci concordi .\n",
      "Vorrei che all' interno dei gruppi politici potessimo prepararci adeguatamente al dibattito sul programma quinquennale .\n",
      "Non è possibile farlo ascoltando una dichiarazione di cui non conosciamo con esattezza il contenuto .\n",
      "Perciò raccomandiamo - e ho l' impressione che anche la Commissione sia disposta ad accogliere questa idea - di discutere in febbraio il programma a lungo termine della Commissione che si estende fino al 2005 - sperando che a quel punto la Commissione abbia concordato un programma che ci sottoporrà - e , sempre in febbraio , anche il programma legislativo della Commissione per l' anno 2000 .\n",
      "E ' dunque sulla base di un nesso oggettivo che proponiamo di discutere contestualmente i due programmi e per questa ragione il mio gruppo politico respinge decisamente la proposta del gruppo socialista !\n",
      "( Applausi dai banchi del gruppo del PPE-DE ) Signora Presidente , desidero affermare chiaramente che , innanzi tutto , la Commissione nutre il massimo rispetto per le decisioni del Parlamento tra cui quella di elaborare il proprio ordine del giorno .\n",
      "Quindi , noi rispettiamo le eventuali decisioni in materia del Parlamento .\n",
      "Ma voglio dire altrettanto chiaramente che il Presidente Prodi si è impegnato con il Parlamento a inserire un nuovo dibattito , come ha ricordato l ' onorevole Barón , oltre al dibattito annuale sul programma legislativo della Commissione , sulle grandi linee di azione per il prossimo quinquennio , cioè per la presente legislatura .\n",
      "Tengo a sottolineare , signora Presidente , che , secondo l ' accordo concluso nel settembre scorso , questo dibattito era distinto dalla presentazione del programma legislativo della Commissione .\n",
      "E desidero far sapere che , per quanto riguarda la Commissione , siamo pronti e disposti a tenere questo dibattito quando lo si ritenga opportuno ; eravamo già pronti a farlo questa settimana , conformemente all ' accordo iniziale , sulla base dell ' intesa di una presentazione del discorso ai gruppi parlamentari il giorno prima .\n",
      "Quindi , signora Presidente , ribadisco che da parte nostra abbiamo discusso del programma di azione per il prossimo quinquennio e che siamo pronti a presentarlo quando vuole il Parlamento - anche questa settimana , se decide il tal senso- mentre il mese prossimo toccherà al programma per il 2000 , esattamente come era stato stabilito .\n",
      "Propongo di porre in votazione la richiesta del gruppo PSE di iscrivere nuovamente all ' ordine del giorno la dichiarazione della Commissione sui suoi obiettivi strategici .\n",
      "( Il Parlamento respinge la richiesta ) Presidente .\n",
      "Sempre sulla giornata di mercoledì ho ricevuto un ' altra proposta di modifica relativa alla interrogazione orale sull ' imposta patrimoniale che il gruppo PPE-DE chiede di ritirare dall ' ordine del giorno .\n",
      "Qualcuno desidera intervenire a nome del gruppo per motivare tale richiesta ?\n",
      "Signora Presidente , sento qualche risata fra i socialisti .\n",
      "Mi è stato detto che anche una parte cospicua del gruppo socialista vorrebbe che questo punto venisse ritirato dall' ordine del giorno , in quanto nella votazione in sede di Conferenza dei presidenti è mancato il voto del gruppo di lavoro dei colleghi competenti del gruppo socialista .\n",
      "Non so se questa informazione sia corretta , ma noi del PPE-DE saremmo comunque grati se il suddetto punto venisse eliminato visto che il Parlamento si è già occupato ripetutamente della questione .\n",
      "Esistono anche alcune decisioni contro tale imposta .\n",
      "Per questa ragione il gruppo del PPE-DE chiede che il punto in questione venga ritirato dall' ordine del giorno .\n",
      "La ringrazio , onorevole Poettering .\n",
      "Ha facoltà l ' onorevole Wurtz che interviene contro la richiesta .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , vorrei innanzi tutto sottolineare la mancanza di logica da parte dell ' onorevole Poettering che ha appena fatto la morale al gruppo socialista per essere tornato su una decisione approvata dalla Conferenza dei presidenti con una netta maggioranza .\n",
      "Ebbene , egli ha fatto la stessa cosa .\n",
      "Si era discusso e tutti si erano detti d ' accordo , tranne il gruppo PPE-DE e il gruppo ELDR .\n",
      "In tale circostanza - gli onorevoli colleghi presidenti lo ricorderanno - avevo altresì sottolineato che il punto non era tanto sapere se siamo a favore o contro la tassa Tobin , ma se abbiamo il coraggio di ascoltare che cosa ne pensano la Commissione e il Consiglio .\n",
      "Non è chiedere molto .\n",
      "Pertanto , reitero la proposta di mantenere all ' ordine del giorno l ' interrogazione orale al Consiglio e alla Commissione , per apprendere , una volta per tutte , la posizione delle due Istituzioni su una proposta relativamente modesta , ma che lancerebbe un segnale importante all ' opinione pubblica , soprattutto sull ' onda dell ' emozione suscitata dal fallimento della Conferenza di Seattle .\n",
      "Pongo ora in votazione la richiesta del gruppo PPE-DE intesa a ritirare dall ' ordine del giorno l ' interrogazione orale sull ' imposta patrimoniale .\n",
      "( Il Parlamento respinge la richiesta con 164 voti favorevoli , 166 contrari e 7 astenuti ) Signora Presidente , ringrazio l ' onorevole Poettering per l ' inaspettata pubblicità che ha appena dato a questa discussione .\n",
      "Grazie !\n",
      "Signora Presidente , è stato contato il mio voto , che non è stato deposto elettronicamente , perché non ho la scheda ?\n",

      "Questa è l ' ultima volta che si terrà conto del voto dei deputati che hanno dimenticato la loro carta di votazione .\n",
      "Che sia ben chiaro per tutti .\n",

      "Le sarei molto grato se prima di chiudere questo punto all' ordine del giorno mi permettesse di rilasciare una dichiarazione di voto a nome del mio gruppo .\n",

      "Consulenti per la sicurezza dei trasporti di merci pericolose L ' ordine del giorno reca la discussione sulla relazione ( A5-0105 / 1999 ) , presentata dall ' on .\n",
      "Koch a nome della commissione per la politica regionale , i trasporti e il turismo , sulla posizione comune definita dal Consiglio in vista dell ' adozione della direttiva del Parlamento europeo e del Consiglio relativa alle prescrizioni minime applicabili all ' esame di consulente per la sicurezza dei trasporti su strada , per ferrovia e per via navigabile di merci pericolose ( C5-0208 / 99 - 1998 / 0106 ( COD ) ) - ( DE ) Signora Commissario , signora Presidente , onorevoli colleghi , accolgo positivamente la posizione comune del Consiglio volta ad armonizzare la formazione dei consulenti per la sicurezza dei trasporti su strada , per ferrovia e per via navigabile di merci pericolose .\n",
      "In primo luogo , faccio rilevare che abbiamo dovuto intervenire formalmente per poter far rispettare le disposizioni della direttiva 96 / 35 / CE che obbliga gli Stati membri ad avvalersi di personale specializzato per le merci pericolose , ovvero consulenti per la sicurezza nonché a organizzare corsi di formazione , addestramento ed esami per queste persone , senza tuttavia dare esplicitamente attuazione a tutto ciò .\n",
      "In secondo luogo , la presente direttiva consente di raggiungere i seguenti obiettivi : a ) aumento della sicurezza sia nel trasporto che nelle operazioni di trasbordo delle merci pericolose ; b ) riduzione delle distorsioni della concorrenza dovute alla diversità dei sistemi di formazione a livello nazionale e dei relativi costi ; c ) parità di opportunità per i consulenti alla sicurezza sul mercato del lavoro europeo .\n",
      "In terzo luogo con questa direttiva , nella sua forma attuale di posizione comune in cui si limita esclusivamente a prescrivere norme minime , possiamo garantire un elevato grado di flessibilità e una regolamentazione minima da parte dell' Unione europea , contribuendo in tal modo a favorire l' assunzione di responsabilità da parte degli Stati membri .\n",
      "Ciò va senz' altro valutato positivamente dal punto di vista della sussidiarietà .\n",
      "Mi pare si sia tenuto conto sufficientemente degli emendamenti da noi presentati in prima lettura .\n",
      "Essi sono stati accolti , e opportunamente inseriti oppure tralasciati nel caso in cui non siano state adottate le relative norme europee , come per esempio per il sistema di sanzioni contro le trasgressioni o il complesso sistema di domande nella prova d' esame .\n",
      "Vi invito a votare a favore dell' emendamento approvato all' unanimità in seno alla commissione per la politica regionale e i trasporti relativo ai tempi di applicazione della direttiva .\n",
      "Non imponendo una scadenza specifica agli Stati membri e concedendo loro un periodo di tre mesi dopo l' entrata in vigore della direttiva , si introduce una clausola di flessibilità che garantisce la sua tempestiva applicazione .\n",
      "Chiedo la vostra approvazione .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , non possiamo e non dobbiamo rassegnarci al continuo aumento degli incidenti che si verificano nel trasporto su strada , per ferrovia e sulle vie navigabili con gravi danni , dovuti non solo ma anche al fatto che il personale addetto non si occupa con sufficiente coscienziosità del trasporto delle merci pericolose ; accade inoltre che , per ignoranza o insufficiente preparazione dei conducenti o di altri addetti ai vari mezzi di trasporto , un piccolo incidente si trasformi in una sciagura di grandi proporzioni .\n",
      "Essendo austriaco mi è rimasta impressa vivamente nella memoria - ma credo lo stesso valga per tutti noi - la sciagura del tunnel nei monti Tauri che è costata la vita a tante persone e in cui solo dopo molti mesi e con un enorme sforzo finanziario si è potuto ricostruire quanto era andato distrutto all' interno del tunnel a causa dell' incendio .\n",
      "I lavori di ricostruzione , durati mesi , hanno provocato l ' interruzione del transito in questa importante arteria di comunicazione fra il nord e il sud dell' Europa .\n",
      "La deviazione del traffico resasi necessaria ha causato disagi ai limiti della tollerabilità a migliaia di cittadini dell' Unione europea .\n",
      "Per alcuni comuni del mio paese la situazione è stata veramente infernale .\n",
      "La nostra risposta a incidenti di questo genere deve essere la prevenzione e il progetto di direttiva oggi in discussione rappresenta un importante presupposto per assicurare un' adeguata formazione ai consulenti per la sicurezza , affinché si intervenga nel modo e nel momento opportuno .\n",
      "Certamente non possiamo accontentarci di creare una normativa europea volta a elevare il grado di sicurezza .\n",
      "Dobbiamo anche assicurarci che le norme introdotte vengano recepite puntualmente dagli Stati membri e , ancor più , che esse vengano infine applicate .\n",
      "Evitiamo , per favore , che si aggiunga un ulteriore ambito in cui si finisca con il dover denunciare le carenze nell' applicazione .\n",
      "Vorrei infine soffermarmi su un ultimo punto .\n",
      "Non dobbiamo accontentarci di colmare un' altra lacuna nella rete di sicurezza , chiudendo gli occhi sul fatto che resta da fare molto di più in materia di sicurezza nel settore dei trasporti in Europa .\n",
      "A tale proposito chiedo alla signora Commissario competente , e qui presente , di presentare al più presto una proposta in merito , affinché in futuro si possa garantire maggiore sicurezza nei trasporti in galleria per non dover più assistere in Europa a sciagure di tale gravità !\n",
      "Signora Presidente , innanzi tutto voglio ringraziare l' onorevole Koch per la sua relazione incentrata sul tema della sicurezza dei trasporti e in particolare sull' armonizzazione delle prescrizioni applicabili all ' esame di consulente per la sicurezza dei trasporti di merci pericolose su strada , ferrovia o vie navigabili interne .\n",
      "Mi congratulo con lui per l' eccellente relazione .\n",
      "Di recente il tema della sicurezza dei trasporti è stato tristemente al centro dell' attenzione dei mass media con l' incidente ferroviario alla stazione di Paddington a Londra , il terribile incidente ferroviario in Norvegia , i due incidenti aerei in cui hanno perso la vita alcuni cittadini dell ' Unione e il disastro ecologico provocato dalla petroliera Erika al largo della costa bretone .\n",
      "Tutti questi incidenti si sono verificati negli ultimi quattro mesi e ci ricordano che la sicurezza dei trasporti non può mai essere data per scontata e che i responsabili della protezione dei cittadini devono essere altamente motivati e qualificati .\n",
      "Il relatore sottolinea che , nella sua posizione comune , il Consiglio ha accolto sei dei dieci emendamenti presentati dal Parlamento in prima lettura e ha ripreso il senso dei quattro restanti .\n",
      "Pertanto il mio gruppo intende votare a favore della suddetta posizione comune e auspica quanto prima l' attuazione della legislazione che ci doterà di un ulteriore strumento per rendere i trasporti nell' Unione europea il più sicuri possibile .\n",
      "Il mio gruppo sarà sempre a favore di qualsiasi iniziativa volta a migliorare la sicurezza dei trasporti .\n",
      "Il lavoro da svolgere in questo settore è ancora molto , come hanno dimostrato gli eventi verificatisi recentemente .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , mi permetta di formulare un paio di osservazioni .\n",
      "Ringrazio innanzi tutto il relatore per il suo lavoro estremamente preciso e tecnico sul fascicolo in parola , e in secondo luogo la Commissione per la proposta presentata .\n",
      "La proposta concerne l' armonizzazione dei requisiti d' esame , tuttavia , in realtà parla anche di norme minime , cosa che io in un certo senso deploro .\n",
      "L' importanza della sicurezza dei trasporti stradali , ferroviari e per vie navigabili interne è indubbia e dato il carattere internazionale di questo tipo di trasporti , anche i corsi di formazione per i consulenti per la sicurezza devono essere armonizzati , come , ad esempio , per il prossimo nuovo ADR .\n",
      "Tutto ciò è importante , ma altrettanto essenziale è l' attuazione delle norme vigenti .\n",
      "Ci sono diversi motivi per dedicare attenzione a questo aspetto , basti guardare quanti incidenti si sono prodotti negli anni scorsi in caso di nebbia in Belgio , o in Olanda o in altri paesi .\n",
      "Tanti sono gli incidenti in cui sono rimasti coinvolti camion che trasportavano merci pericolose e che in tali condizioni meteorologiche non avrebbero dovuto viaggiare invece di trovarsi tranquillamente sulle strade .\n",
      "Oppure pensiamo alle navi provenienti dai paesi dell' Europa orientale che navigano in condizioni chiaramente pericolose .\n",
      "Da indagini condotte nei porti belgi , finlandesi e anche giapponesi è altresì emerso che il 50 percento dei container contenenti in parte merci pericolose , non viene consegnato nel rispetto delle norme vigenti .\n",
      "In breve , l' importanza del tema è enorme .\n",
      "Per quanto attiene alla situazione dei consulenti per la sicurezza , in alcuni Stati membri a partire dal 1º gennaio di quest' anno le aziende devono obbligatoriamente averne uno interno .\n",
      "Attualmente i problemi creati da questa norma sono molti , soprattutto per le aziende più piccole , che non dispongono di mezzi finanziari sufficienti .\n",
      "Di conseguenza tali aziende sono costrette a rinunciare al loro carico oppure a mescolarlo ad un altro carico , con i seri problemi che ciò genera .\n",
      "Per tale motivo si chiede alle aziende di integrare tali attività nei rendiconti finanziari , oppure nelle analisi aziendali , da inserire eventualmente in certificazioni ISO 9002 .\n",
      "Il quadro normativo è pronto , adesso dobbiamo occuparci della sua attuazione .\n",
      "Permettetemi di indicare un ultimo punto , sempre concernente l' applicazione delle norme .\n",
      "Occorre formulare degli accordi soddisfacenti con i paesi dell' Europa orientale , dato che essi aderiranno ai trattati in materia solo a partire dal 1º luglio 2001 , cioè soltanto fra un anno e mezzo .\n",
      "Tali paesi adesso godono di un leggero vantaggio concorrenziale , il che non è grave .\n",
      "Tuttavia , io credo che si debba dare la precedenza agli aspetti che riguardano la sicurezza dei trasporti stradali , ferroviari e per vie navigabili interne , e presentare tempestivamente questa parte dell' acquis comunitario ai paesi candidati all' adesione .\n",
      "Signora Presidente , in questo Parlamento , a ragione per altro , si pone regolarmente in risalto l' importanza della sicurezza dei trasporti .\n",
      "I volumi sempre crescenti di merci che attraversano l' Europa comportano , consapevolmente o meno , rischi di tutti i generi per il personale , l' ambiente e la società .\n",
      "Pertanto , coloro che devono gestire i suddetti rischi devono soddisfare requisiti molto rigorosi .\n",
      "Le norme sancite in un' altra direttiva , la direttiva 95 / 35 / CE , paiono sufficientemente adeguate per fornire una consulenza responsabile sull' organizzazione dei trasporti di merci pericolose .\n",
      "Mi rallegro che si sia raggiunta un' intesa con il Consiglio in materia di requisiti minimi per gli esami dei consulenti per la sicurezza , sebbene avrei preferito che fossero stati formulati norme e programmi uniformi atti a garantire l ' uguaglianza dei diplomi a livello internazionale .\n",
      "Tuttavia , pare che il mio sia solo un pio desiderio .\n",
      "Infine , l' emendamento proposto dal relatore è più che logico e pertanto può contare su tutto il mio appoggio .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signora Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , innanzi tutto vorrei congratularmi con l ' onorevole Koch per le relazioni presentate .\n",
      "Pur trattandosi di relazioni di carattere tecnico , rivestono grande importanza dal punto di vista della sicurezza .\n",
      "Mi limiterò a poche considerazioni .\n",
      "In primo luogo vorrei pregare la signora Commissario - e sono convinto che la mia richiesta troverà un terreno fertile - di adoperarsi affinché venga dedicata maggiore attenzione alla questione della sicurezza nei trasporti su strada , nonché nella navigazione marittima e nelle acque interne .\n",
      "Constatando che la prima proposta della Commissione è stata presentata il 19 marzo 1998 e che oggi ce ne stiamo ancora occupando - benché il Parlamento si sia attivato con una certa tempestività - devo far rilevare che si è proceduto con eccessiva lentezza .\n",
      "Ciò non va imputato soltanto alla Commissione ma credo che dobbiamo attivarci più rapidamente per giungere a un' armonizzazione anche in questo ambito .\n",
      "Il secondo punto è già stato ricordato e riguarda le norme minime .\n",
      "In generale sono dell' idea che in numerosi settori all' interno dei trasporti sarebbero auspicabili una maggiore flessibilità e normative nazionali .\n",
      "Per quanto riguarda la sicurezza invece sono piuttosto scettico in quanto la sicurezza in Svezia non è sostanzialmente diversa dalla sicurezza in Germania , in Italia o in Austria .\n",
      "Posso anche accettare queste norme minime , ma esorto la Commissione a esercitare un' attenta sorveglianza .\n",
      "Nel caso in cui questo tipo di flessibilità dovesse dare adito a un' insufficiente regolamentazione in alcuni paesi occorrerà procedere a una ulteriore armonizzazione .\n",
      "Anche il terzo punto è già stato toccato .\n",
      "Anch' io , come l ' onorevole Rack , provengo da un paese di transito in cui la questione assume particolare importanza .\n",
      "Non ci proponiamo di peggiorare unilateralmente le condizioni di concorrenza per alcuni paesi , favorendo paesi di transito come l' Austria .\n",
      "Credo tuttavia che occorra fare tutto ciò che rientra nelle nostre possibilità per limitare il più possibile il trasporto di merci pericolose in tutti i paesi , siano essi di transito o meno .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , desidero innanzi tutto congratularmi con il relatore onorevole Koch per il magnifico lavoro e la proficua collaborazione instaurata con la Commissione per migliorare i testi e presentare la relazione nonché la proposta ; alla fine c ' è un unico emendamento , relativo alle prescrizioni applicabili all ' esame attitudinale dei consulenti per la sicurezza dei trasporti di merci pericolose su strada , per ferrovia e per via navigabile .\n",
      "A nostro avviso , sono importanti la collaborazione e il lavoro svolto insieme dalle due Istituzioni - Parlamento e Commissione - e la collaborazione esistente con la commissione per la politica regionale , e in particolare con il gruppo trasporti , è straordinaria .\n",
      "La posizione comune riprende praticamente tutti gli emendamenti accolti dalla Commissione ed armonizza le prescrizioni minime applicabili all ' esame di consulente per la sicurezza : in seconda lettura , possiamo pertanto accettare l ' emendamento relativo alla data di recepimento proposta , molto più realistica rispetto a quella avanzata inizialmente dalla Commissione , visto che sono già vari anni che discutiamo della questione .\n",
      "Desidero inoltre ringraziare brevemente i vari deputati per i loro interventi e dire loro che per la Commissione la sicurezza è una priorità nell ' ambito dei trasporti .\n",
      "E come ha detto molto giustamente l ' onorevole Simpson , il processo non si può mai dare per scontato , acquisito o concluso .\n",
      "L ' incremento dei margini , delle garanzie di sicurezza nei trasporti è un processo che deve continuare a migliorare giorno dopo giorno .\n",
      "In tal senso , desidero anche fare brevemente riferimento ai problemi dei tunnel , menzionati dagli onorevoli Rack e Swoboda .\n",
      "Nel caso dell ' Austria , si tratta indubbiamente di un tema molto sensibile , che richiede uno sforzo per vedere come accrescerne la sicurezza .\n",
      "In uno dei gravi incidenti verificatisi recentemente , la merce trasportata non era di per sé pericolosa .\n",
      "La margarina e qualche chilo di vernice che , in linea di massima , non comportavano rischi , hanno provocato un ' autentica catastrofe .\n",
      "E ' necessario pertanto considerare come sia possibile perfezionare ulteriormente i criteri per garantire la massima sicurezza .\n",
      "Infine , ribadisco che dobbiamo considerare la sicurezza in tutti i tipi di trasporti .\n",
      "Questa settimana terremo in questa sede un dibattito sulla sicurezza del trasporto marittimo , in seguito alla catastrofe dell ' Erika , e nel corso di quest ' anno dovremo discutere degli obiettivi in materia di sicurezza del trasporto aereo .\n",
      "Ma , onorevoli deputati , la sicurezza è un obiettivo prioritario della Commissione .\n",
      "Come avrò modo di dichiarare nel corso del dibattito sull ' Erika , non aspettiamo una catastrofe per dedicarci all ' esame della questione della sicurezza , ma vi lavoriamo a prescindere da questi avvenimenti , che non fanno altro che dimostrare quanto sia urgente dare una risposta efficace a questo tipo di problemi .\n",
      "Ringrazio ancora una volta tutti coloro che sono intervenuti , e in particolare il relatore onorevole Koch .\n",
      "La discussione è chiusa .\n",
      "La votazione si svolgerà domani , alle 12.00 .\n",

      "Trasporto di merci pericolose su strada L' ordine del giorno reca la relazione ( A5-0104 / 1999 ) presentata dall' onorevole Koch a nome della commissione per la politica regionale , i trasporti e il turismo sulla proposta di direttiva del Parlamento europeo e del Consiglio [ COM ( 1999 ) 158 - C5-0004 / 1999 - 1999 / 0083 ( COD ) ] che modifica la direttiva 94 / 55 / CE concernente il ravvicinamento delle legislazioni degli Stati membri relative al trasporto di merci pericolose su strada .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signora Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , la direttiva entrata in vigore il 1º gennaio 1997 concernente il ravvicinamento delle legislazioni degli Stati membri relative al trasporto di merci pericolose su strada contiene alcune norme transitorie la cui validità è a termine e dipende dalla conclusione di alcuni lavori di normazione da parte del CEN , il Comitato europeo di normalizzazione .\n",
      "I ritardi nei lavori del CEN hanno comportato problemi nell' applicazione della suddetta direttiva .\n",
      "In particolare , gli allegati non hanno potuto essere adeguati ai più recenti sviluppi nel settore tecnologico e industriale .\n",
      "Ciò è a mio avviso deplorevole e ci costringe a intervenire per ovviare ad inadempienze altrui .\n",
      "Accetto pertanto la proposta di modifica della direttiva 94 / 55 / CE oggi in discussione .\n",
      "Un mancato intervento da parte dell' Unione europea obbligherebbe gli Stati membri a modificare le proprie disposizioni legislative nazionali per un breve periodo , ovvero fino alla conclusione dei lavori del CEN , il che comporterebbe inutili costi e incertezze .\n",
      "La modifica della direttiva oggi in discussione non implica la modifica dell' armonizzazione attualmente vigente all' interno della Comunità delle norme in materia di trasporto di merci pericolose .\n",
      "Essa si limita a prolungare le norme transitorie rinviando le scadenze , a eliminare le disposizioni ritenute ormai obsolete e a disciplinare le procedure nei seguenti casi : a ) trasporti ad hoc di merci pericolose ; b ) emanazione di norme nazionali meno severe , in particolare per quanto riguarda il trasporto di quantitativi molto ridotti di merci pericolose in ambito locale chiaramente definito .\n",
      "La modifica della direttiva risulta pertanto pienamente conforme al principio di sussidiarietà ; agli Stati membri vengono attribuite maggiori competenze .\n",
      "La Commissione stabilisce se gli Stati membri possano emanare determinate disposizioni , assistita in questo compito da un comitato di esperti nel settore delle merci pericolose ai sensi della procedura legislativa .\n",
      "Le modalità per l' esercizio di tali competenze di esecuzione da parte della Commissione sono state riviste con una decisione del Consiglio del giugno 1999 .\n",
      "La proposta di direttiva concernente il trasporto di merci pericolose su strada oggi in discussione risale tuttavia al maggio 1999 e , pertanto , non ha potuto tenere conto della procedura di comitatologia attualmente vigente .\n",
      "Gli emendamenti presentati e approvati all' unanimità in sede di commissione fanno riferimento in due casi alla suddetta procedura di comitatologia recentemente modificata .\n",
      "Intendiamo assicurare che tale riferimento figuri già nei considerando e che il termine stabilito in modo inequivocabile entro il quale il Consiglio deve prendere una decisione venga fissato al massimo entro tre mesi .\n",
      "Si sottolinea inoltre la necessità di una maggiore trasparenza .\n",
      "Un altro emendamento consente agli Stati membri di stabilire requisiti più rigorosi , soprattutto per le cisterne qualora la temperatura ambiente alla quale si lavora e si effettuano i trasporti sia di solito inferiore a -20º .\n",
      "Ciò nell' interesse , soprattutto , delle regioni dell' Europa settentrionale .\n",
      "Un ultimo emendamento si propone di consentire che continuino ad essere utilizzati per il trasporto nazionale cisterne e veicoli immatricolati nel periodo compreso fra il 1º gennaio 1997 e l' entrata in vigore della direttiva , la cui costruzione e manutenzione sia in linea con i requisiti della stessa direttiva .\n",
      "Pur sapendo che si tratta soltanto di un piccolo passo verso una maggiore sicurezza , vi invito a votare a favore della relazione .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , onorevoli colleghi , buon anno e buon nuovo millennio .\n",
      "E ' la prima volta che intervengo in Plenaria e devo ammettere di essere molto emozionato , un po ' come succede con il primo amore che però , per fortuna , è durato più di due minuti .\n",
      "Vorrei commentare brevemente la proposta presentata dalla Commissione in merito alla modifica della direttiva sul trasporto su strada delle merci pericolose .\n",
      "Ritengo sia importante che questa direttiva sia approvata adesso ; altrimenti gli Stati membri sarebbero costretti a modificare le proprie leggi nazionali per un periodo di tempo estremamente breve e ciò comporterebbe solamente costi aggiuntivi e , ancora una volta , accrescerebbe l' irritazione dei cittadini verso la burocrazia dell' UE .\n",
      "D ' altro canto , nella proposta della Commissione non vengono presi in considerazione alcuni elementi , come il clima rigido delle regioni nordiche .\n",
      "Ho ritenuto pertanto opportuno proporre alcuni emendamenti da inserire nell ' eccellente relazione dell' onorevole Koch , che sono stati approvati in sede di commissione .\n",
      "Tali emendamenti riguardano la resistenza alle basse temperature dei serbatoi adibiti al trasporto delle merci pericolose .\n",
      "Nella proposta della Commissione si era pensato che meno venti gradi sarebbero stati sufficienti ; per coloro che vivono nel bacino del Mediterraneo è difficile immaginare che in Lapponia le temperature possono raggiungere ben altri valori .\n",
      "Onorevoli colleghi , anche in Lapponia si sostiene l' attività dell' Unione europea , quindi sarebbe importante tenere maggiormente conto di questa area .\n",
      "Di conseguenza , ho proposto di ridurre il limite a meno quaranta gradi .\n",
      "Tale modifica sarebbe necessaria anche per lasciare immutato lo standard di sicurezza in vigore nelle regioni nordiche .\n",
      "Spero che la mia proposta venga presa in considerazione nel corso della votazione di domani .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , se lei permette vorrei innanzi tutto congratularmi per come , nel corso della discussione , ha effettuato il cambio della Presidenza .\n",
      "L' ho trovato perfetto .\n",
      "Entrando nel merito , ritengo che i cittadini europei debbano poter essere certi che i trasporti in Europa su strada , per ferrovia o con altri mezzi , avvengano in condizioni di massima sicurezza , anche nel caso in cui si tratti di merci pericolose .\n",
      "La presente direttiva è un contributo in questa direzione .\n",
      "Il fatto che oggi siamo chiamati a intervenire è , in linea di principio , scandaloso .\n",
      "Il relatore , onorevole Koch , al quale esprimiamo la nostra gratitudine per il lavoro svolto , ha fatto rilevare che avrebbero già potuto essere compiuti alcuni progressi se non si fossero verificati ritardi nei lavori del CEN dovuti alla lentezza nell' elaborazione e nel ravvicinamento della direttiva .\n",
      "Non ci resta dunque che sperare - entro questa settimana dovremmo decidere il tutto - che nel 2001 possiamo finalmente disporre di norme comunitarie in materia di trasporto di merci pericolose su strada , beneficiando in tal modo sia di una maggiore certezza del diritto che di una maggiore sicurezza sulle nostre strade .\n",
      "Signora Commissario , signor Presidente , ringrazio in primo luogo l' onorevole Koch per la sua relazione , che trovo eccellente e alla quale non intendo aggiungere gran che .\n",
      "Colgo l' occasione soltanto per sottolineare che non solo in India , paese dal quale sono appena ritornato , ma anche nell' Unione europea il trasporto di merci pericolose continua a provocare gravi problemi .\n",
      "Basti pensare al grave incidente verificatosi circa un anno fa nel tunnel del Monte Bianco o a quello nella galleria dei Monti Tauri .\n",
      "Constatiamo che ogni volta che le condizioni naturali determinano delle difficoltà - nebbia , tempeste , freddo - soprattutto nei punti di strozzatura delle Alpi si possono verificare gravi problemi .\n",
      "In generale auspico che il trasporto di merci pericolose venga effettuato in maggiore misura per ferrovia .\n",
      "A tale proposito occorre individuare già in fase di progettazione dei futuri tratti - sino essi ferroviari o autostradali - la soluzione giusta .\n",
      "Pensiamo ad esempio al tunnel di base del Brennero che non è ancora stato discusso adeguatamente .\n",
      "A tale proposito vorrei anche richiamare l' attenzione sul fatto che la problematica dei trasporti è fra le questioni chiave dell' Unione europea e prego la Commissione di tenerne conto .\n",
      "Dobbiamo affrontare più approfonditamente e a lungo termine aspetti quali la limitazione dei trasporti , il trasporto pesante per ferrovia , il road pricing e la privatizzazione delle ferrovie al fine di migliorare la funzionalità .\n",
      "Tenendo conto che una delle conseguenze dell' ampliamento a est sarà fra l' altro l' aggravarsi di questi problemi , risulterà evidente a noi tutti che la credibilità dell' Unione europea in futuro si misurerà anche in base a come verrà disciplinato il settore dei trasporti .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , la relazione che trattiamo ora non contempla , in sé , cambiamenti di vasta portata .\n",
      "La maggior parte degli emendamenti sono di carattere squisitamente tecnico , ma vale comunque la pena di ricordare come , ogni volta che assumiamo decisioni di questo tipo , noi operiamo a favore dell' ambiente in senso lato , con il vantaggio di creare condizioni migliori per il corretto funzionamento del mercato interno .\n",
      "Sulll' intero territorio dell' Unione vengono trasportati notevoli quantitativi di merci pericolose , che transitano sulle strade , sulle ferrovie e attraverso i porti .\n",
      "Ciò rende necessario il varo di un' adeguata regolamentazione di questo tipo di attività .\n",
      "Settore dopo settore , si assiste all' approvazione progressiva di norme minime che gli Stati membri debbono rispettare .\n",
      "Mi pare questa un' evoluzione estremamente positiva ; al relatore Koch va il nostro ringraziamento per il lavoro svolto in tale ambito .\n",
      "L' impatto di queste regole è importante anche ai fini del mercato interno .\n",
      "Se si desidera , infatti , che il mercato interno dei trasporti possa funzionare adeguatamente , diviene allora importante non soltanto dotarsi di regole , ma anche assicurare che tali regole siano , nel massimo grado possibile , regole comuni .\n",
      "In conclusione , desidero fare una terza osservazione , pure di sostanziale importanza , in merito a un emendamento presentato dall' onorevole Vatanen .\n",
      "Le condizioni contingenti variano notevolmente da un paese all' altro .\n",
      "Con l' approvazione di questo emendamento si terrebbe conto del fatto che nelle regioni settentrionali dell' Unione può fare molto freddo .\n",
      "Ciò rende necessario , a sua volta , tenere conto dei possibili effetti di temperature tanto rigide su materiali e imballaggi .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , in questo tipo di regolamentazioni è molto importante sforzarsi di essere flessibili ; spero quindi che la Commissione potrà accogliere questo emendamento .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , vorrei ringraziare non soltanto il collega , onorevole Koch , ma anche la Vicepresidente della Commissione per aver riconosciuto in modo tanto chiaro ed inequivocabile l' importanza della sicurezza nel settore dei trasporti e la priorità della sicurezza .\n",
      "Il collega Koch ha dovuto preparare la sua pregevole relazione in quanto i lavori del CEN e anche quelli della Commissione economica delle Nazioni Unite non sono stati svolti con la dovuta celerità .\n",
      "Vorrei chiedere alla Vicepresidente se oggi è in grado di dirci qualcosa sullo stato di avanzamento degli sforzi di armonizzazione da parte delle due organizzazioni summenzionate e se l' Unione europea ha la possibilità di accelerare l' armonizzazione adottando principi il più possibile semplici .\n",
      "E ' infatti evidente che anche nel caso in cui all' interno dell' Unione europea venissero adottate norme pienamente adeguate , i mezzi di trasporto non si fermerebbero ai suoi confini .\n",
      "Pertanto è senz' altro opportuno prevedere disposizioni che vanno al di là della dimensione regionale .\n",
      "Se la signora Commissario non è in grado di farlo oggi , sarebbe comunque disposta a informare per iscritto la commissione parlamentare sullo stato delle cose e sullo stato dei negoziati fra CEN e Commissione economica ?\n",
      "Signor Presidente , mi congratulo nuovamente con l ' onorevole Koch per il lavoro svolto a proposito di quest ' altra relazione che , in un certo qual modo , completa il dibattito che abbiamo tenuto lo scorso ottobre sul trasporto ferroviario .\n",
      "Ci rammarichiamo tutti che il Comitato europeo di normalizzazione ( CEN ) non sia riuscito a concludere entro il termine richiesto la modifica delle norme necessarie per giungere a un ' armonizzazione adeguata in seno all ' Unione europea .\n",
      "Questo dibattito e la modifica della direttiva attualmente in vigore ci permettono di tener conto di differenze di fatto che testimoniano la diversità della nostra Europa .\n",
      "Poco fa l ' onorevole Vatanen ci parlava di temperature inferiori non a 20 gradi sotto zero , ma a 40 gradi sotto zero .\n",
      "Naturalmente accettiamo questo emendamento , ha perfettamente ragione .\n",
      "Credo che si debba tener conto di circostanze materiali , che dimostrano la varietà climatica dell ' Unione europea e che poi si traducono talvolta in specifiche e requisiti concreti , quando si tratta di formulare normalizzazioni o caratteristiche di tipo tecnico .\n",
      "A proposito di quanto ha detto l ' onorevole Swoboda sull ' attività del CEN , stiamo sollecitando affinché i lavori vengano accelerati al massimo , in quanto sarebbe terribile se , nonostante la nuova scadenza , tra poco più di un anno ci ritrovassimo di fronte alle stesse difficoltà perché non l ' hanno concluso .\n",
      "Infine , signor Presidente , sono già stati segnalati i problemi fondamentali che giustificano la modifica della direttiva , abbiamo menzionato il ritardo del CEN , la modifica di talune norme , la coerenza tra il testo della direttiva e il contenuto degli allegati , la necessità di una maggioreprecisione .\n",
      "Tutti i contributi della commissione parlamentare e del relatore , onorevole Koch , tradotti in vari emendamenti , che sono concretamente quattro , sono stati accolti dalla Commissione .\n",
      "Quindi accettiamo i quattro emendamenti che ci sono stati presentati .\n",
      "La discussione è chiusa .\n",
      "La votazione si svolgerà domani , alle 12.00 .\n",

      "Coordinamento Fondi strutturali / Fondo di coesione L' ordine del giorno reca la relazione ( A5-0108 / 1999 ) presentata dalla onorevole Schroedter a nome della commissione per la politica regionale , i trasporti e il turismo sulla comunicazione della Commissione relativa ai Fondi strutturali e al coordinamento con il Fondo di coesione - Linee direttrici per i programmi del periodo 2000-2006 [ COM ( 1999 ) 344 - C5-0122 / 1999 - 1999 / 2127 ( COS ) ] . - ( DE ) Signor Presidente , signora Commissario .\n",
      "Ah , ecco c' è anche il signor Commissario , pensavo non che non venisse .\n",
      "Benvenuto in questo Parlamento !\n",
      "Onorevoli colleghi , non possiamo ignorare che i benefici del mercato unico europeo si concentrano nelle regioni ricche e che , anche all' interno di esse , non sono equamente ripartiti fra tutti gli strati della popolazione .\n",
      "Per quanto tempo vogliamo continuare ad accettare uno sviluppo che finisce per approfondire il divario crescente fra regioni ricche e regioni povere ?\n",
      "Mentre nella quinta relazione sulla situazione delle regioni la disoccupazione nelle regioni povere risultava di sette volte superiore ai livelli delle regioni ricche , nella sesta relazione si parla già di una disoccupazione di otto volte superiore , nonostante i contributi dei Fondi strutturali destinati a queste regioni .\n",
      "Pertanto , non sorprende nessuno , ovviamente , che già in vista del nuovo regolamento sui Fondi strutturali si chieda a gran voce che le risorse vengano impiegate con maggiore efficienza e concentrazione a favore di obiettivi europei quali l' aumento dei livelli occupazionali e lo sviluppo sostenibile , per citarne solo alcuni .\n",
      "Il Parlamento , ma soprattutto gli Stati membri , avevano chiesto consistenti miglioramenti .\n",
      "La cosa è però stata ben presto dimenticata quando la Commissione ha elaborato il nuovo strumento a tal fine , le linee direttrici , e si è proposta di rendere maggiormente vincolante la richiesta di efficienza , concentrazione e semplificazione amministrativa nell' utilizzo dei Fondi strutturali europei .\n",
      "A quel punto , i governi degli Stati membri hanno fatto appello al principio di sussidiarietà nell' intento di ottenere semplicemente la restituzione dei soldi .\n",
      "Ciò che resta del Vertice di Berlino del 1999 è soltanto il carattere indicativo delle linee direttrici che , per lo meno , obbliga la Commissione ad approvare soltanto i programmi che veramente consentono di raggiungere gli obiettivi europei .\n",
      "Benché nutra qualche dubbio sul fatto che un tale strumento indicativo sia davvero sufficiente ad assicurare efficienza e concentrazione e ad attuare realmente gli obiettivi europei , è comunque un dato di fatto che le linee direttrici rivestiranno un' importanza fondamentale nei negoziati sui criteri di finanziamento comunitari .\n",
      "Se si vuole che l' intervento a livello europeo venga preso sul serio occorre attribuire la dovuta importanza anche alle linee direttrici !\n",
      "Il Parlamento non ha avuto la possibilità di entrare nel merito delle linee direttrici in quanto è stato consultato soltanto a legislatura da tempo conclusa .\n",
      "Ora che la programmazione è ormai in fase avanzata non ha molto senso riconsiderare tutti gli aspetti .\n",
      "Pertanto nella mia relazione mi limito , come concordato in sede di commissione , a prendere in esame il carattere strategico dello strumento .\n",
      "Primo : la relazione verifica l' efficacia dello strumento in sé .\n",
      "Secondo : colma le lacune presenti nel documento della Commissione .\n",
      "Nella parte centrale sui Fondi strutturali , per esempio , è stato completamente omesso l' aspetto del partenariato .\n",
      "Invano si ricerca nel testo qualche cenno a questo principio fondamentale che induce gli Stati membri a elaborare i programmi di concerto non solo con i comuni e le regioni ma anche con gli interlocutori locali , le organizzazioni economiche e sociali , le ONG , i sindacati , le associazioni imprenditoriali , le associazioni femminili , i gruppi di iniziativa civica , le iniziative a favore dell' occupazione presenti sul territorio .\n",
      "Alla domanda come mai sia stato omesso qualsiasi cenno al partenariato non ho ancora ricevuto risposta .\n",
      "In questo ambito il Parlamento pone richieste di fondamentale importanza e chiede alla Commissione di approvare soltanto i programmi avviati nel quadro di tale partenariato .\n",
      "Mi sorprende , onorevoli colleghi del gruppo conservatore , constatare l' improvvisa comparsa di emendamenti contrari all' impostazione decentrata .\n",
      "Mi limito a invitarvi a recarvi nelle vostre regioni a spiegare ai elettori come mai nelle regioni non dovrebbe venire applicato il principio europeo del decentramento .\n",
      "Sono certa che non ne uscireste del tutto illesi .\n",
      "E ' inammissibile che in quest' Aula si concordino alcuni principi e che , al momento della loro applicazione , ognuno faccia ciò che vuole .\n",
      "Mi sia consentita a tale proposito una osservazione rivolta al governo del mio paese , nel quale si vuole ignorare la politica comunitaria orizzontale in materia di tutela dell' ambiente affermando che non si è tenuti ad applicare la direttiva FFH .\n",
      "Mi pare giusto che la Commissione mantenga una posizione rigorosa su questo aspetto .\n",
      "Mi ricollego così all' ultimo punto .\n",
      "Le linee direttrici devono essere un concreto parametro di verifica del grado di effettiva attuazione dell' articolo 1 del regolamento .\n",
      "Chiedo alla Commissione che le linee direttrici , che certamente sono uno strumento dotato di sufficiente flessibilità , rappresentino effettivamente il criterio alla base dei negoziati .\n",
      "Noi rappresentiamo la posizione europea .\n",
      "Ciò significa che occorre tenere conto della sostenibilità nella politica dei trasporti , della quota di incentivi riservata alle donne e , infine , del fatto che ciascun programma prevede anche sovvenzioni globali finalizzate a uno sviluppo urbano sostenibile e all' effettiva realizzazione di progetti modello nelle aree rurali .\n",
      "Mi aspetto che i criteri comunitari di finanziamento diano questi risultati e che non si ceda ulteriormente .\n",
      "In che modo , infatti , riusciremo a ridurre il tasso di disoccupazione se continuiamo a temporeggiare , se di nuovo ricorriamo a mistificazioni ?\n",
      "Non possiamo attendere oltre !\n",
      "Questi sono gli ultimi anni in cui la politica strutturale europea potrà ancora essere finanziata con risorse di tale entità .\n",
      "Successivamente si aggiungeranno molti altri paesi e , a quel punto , dovremo inevitabilmente creare strutture migliori , più efficienti e concentrate .\n",
      "E non è che l' inizio .\n",
      "Per questo chiedo alla Commissione di tenere in seria considerazione le richieste del Parlamento nel corso dei negoziati e di attuare realmente la posizione europea , dando infine davvero una chance ad una politica regionale avanzata . .\n",
      "( EN ) Signor Presidente , è per me un particolare piacere poter tenere il mio primo intervento al Parlamento europeo sul tema considerato il più importante nella regione del Regno Unito che io rappresento in questo Parlamento , il Galles .\n",
      "Come sicuramente saprete , gran parte del Galles ha ottenuto lo status di regione dell' obiettivo 1 nell' ambito del programma dei Fondi strutturali .\n",
      "E ' dunque ovvio che molti in Galles guardino al programma europeo dei Fondi strutturali come alla soluzione per alleviare alcuni dei più gravi problemi che indubbiamente siamo chiamati ad affrontare .\n",
      "La povertà in Galles è in aumento , e dal 1997 è ulteriormente peggiorata , mentre il divario fra ricchi e poveri si è ampliato .\n",
      "Pertanto dal programma dei Fondi strutturali non ci aspettiamo solo la ristrutturazione industriale , ma anche un consistente potenziamento dell ' intero tessuto economico del Galles .\n",
      "Tuttavia , la convinzione che il sostegno dei Fondi strutturali rappresenti in qualche modo un successo del governo britannico è un atteggiamento che ci danneggia profondamente .\n",
      "In realtà , purtroppo non è altro che il riconoscimento delle enormi difficoltà del Galles .\n",
      "Questo è il motivo per cui tengo a mettere in risalto taluni degli aspetti che a mio avviso la Commissione dovrebbe considerare prioritari .\n",
      "Ci aspettiamo che la Commissione affronti le questioni legate all ' addizionalità .\n",
      "Deploriamo che quelle cifre in qualche modo siano state nascoste all' interno dei dati relativi a tutto il Regno Unito .\n",
      "Ci aspettiamo altresì che la Commissione garantisca un adeguato finanziamento per i vari progetti .\n",
      "Ci aspettiamo che esiga dal governo britannico il coinvolgimento del settore privato nella fase di pianificazione , dato che senza dubbio dovrà fornire l' impulso maggiore per l' utilizzo dei finanziamenti a titolo dei Fondi strutturali .\n",
      "Infine , chiediamo alla Commissione di garantire che le risorse provenienti dai Fondi strutturali vengano spese in modo trasparente .\n",
      "Troppe cose in questo Parlamento non avvengono in modo trasparente .\n",
      "Credo che in questo settore la Commissione potrà essere una grande alleata del Galles .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , la nostra commissione ha discusso l' argomento , analizzandolo da molti punti di vista .\n",
      "Inizierò il mio intervento illustrandovi l ' aspetto della ricerca .\n",
      "La nostra commissione considera estremamente positivo il fatto che la relatrice abbia inserito nelle conclusioni la nostra proposta di potenziare le infrastrutture per la ricerca nei paesi destinatari dei Fondi di coesione , investendo soprattutto nelle università e negli istituti di istruzione in modo da permettere loro di meglio soddisfare le esigenze degli abitanti delle aree non sviluppate e di far sì che i laureati rimangano nelle proprie regioni di origine .\n",
      "Quest' intervento pubblico è realizzabile e la decentralizzazione dell' istruzione universitaria contribuirebbe sicuramente a bilanciare la politica di sviluppo .\n",
      "Un altro punto che desideriamo sottolineare è invece legato alla politica industriale .\n",
      "Nella programmazione del coordinamento dei Fondi strutturali e dei Fondi di coesione , la Commissione avrebbe dovuto tenere maggiormente in considerazione l' importanza del terziario , del commercio elettronico e della diffusione dell' uso di Internet .\n",
      "In passato la povertà e la ricchezza dipendevano soprattutto dalla struttura del tessuto economico locale .\n",
      "Le regioni con maggior presenza industriale venivano , infatti , considerate ricche .\n",
      "Oggi la situazione è completamente diversa , anzi siamo arrivati all' opposto , e queste regioni si sono impoverite .\n",
      "E ' pertanto importante investire in nuovi settori , nella cosiddetta produzione elettronica e nel terziario , che rappresentano il futuro .\n",
      "Ciò , a mio parere , è stato quasi ignorato dalla commissione competente che ha preparato questa relazione .\n",
      "La commissione per l' industria , il commercio estero , la ricerca e l' energia esorta quindi la Commissione a dedicare maggior attenzione a questo tema .\n",
      "Infine , in veste di commissione per l' energia , avremmo voluto vedere un maggior sostegno finanziario per le risorse energetiche rinnovabili attraverso l' uso dei Fondi strutturali e dei Fondi di sviluppo regionale .\n",
      "In questo modo sarebbe stato promosso un maggior uso delle fonti energetiche rinnovabili , compensando i fondi insufficienti del programma di sviluppo energetico . .\n",
      "( EN ) Signor Presidente , i miei più vivi ringraziamenti alla onorevole Schroedter per il lavoro svolto .\n",
      "Vorrei spiegare ai miei colleghi che intervengo al posto della onorevole Flautre , che ha seguito questa pratica in sede di commissione per l' occupazione e gli affari sociali , ma che purtroppo non si sta bene .\n",
      "Desidero attirare la vostra attenzione sugli emendamenti nn .\n",
      "1 e 2 , approvati in sede di commissione per l' occupazione egli affari sociali , ma non di commissione per la politica regionale , i trasporti e il turismo .\n",
      "Tali emendamenti trattano dell' economia sociale e della necessità di fornire capitale sociale di rischio e di dare sostegno finanziario alle iniziative locali volte a creare posti di lavoro e a rafforzare la coesione sociale .\n",
      "In passato questo Parlamento ha riconosciuto il grosso potenziale di creazione di occupazione dell' economia sociale .\n",
      "Pertanto i suddetti emendamenti combaciano con la posizione del Parlamento secondo cui l' esclusione sociale è un grave problema che richiede un intervento costruttivo .\n",
      "Speriamo che coloro che stanno pensando di votare contro tali emendamenti abbiano motivi assai validi da presentare al Parlamento e ai cittadini in cerca di lavoro .\n",
      "Nella sua relazione , la onorevole Flautre pone altresì in risalto un campo in cui sussiste una dolorosa carenza di coordinamento , di cui invece si registra un disperato bisogno .\n",
      "Le proposte della Commissione si riferiscono ai quattro pilastri della strategia per l' occupazione e ai cinque campi d' azione del Fondo sociale europeo .\n",
      "La mancanza di linee direttrici specifiche qui si fa sentire con particolare intensità , dato che l' idea di collegare gli aiuti del Fondo sociale alla strategia per l' occupazione verrà realizzata per la prima volta durante il periodo di programmazione 2000-2006 .\n",
      "Questa omissione fa sembrare che la Commissione stessa non sappia minimamente come garantire il massimo coordinamento fra il sostegno a titolo del Fondo sociale europeo , soggetto a revisione dopo tre anni e mezzo , e i piani d' azione nazionali annuali per l ' occupazione degli Stati membri .\n",
      "Speriamo che la Commissione ci possa rassicurare che si è trattato di una svista nei confronti della quale si sta correndo ai ripari con atteggiamento costruttivo .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , la proposta presentata dalla Commissione conformemente al suo mandato costituisce un punto di partenza ragionevole per la commissione per l ' agricoltura e lo sviluppo rurale .\n",
      "Io però terrei a sottolineare che questo punto di partenza ci indica le sfide che ci attendono : fare in modo che la popolazione non abbandoni le zone rurali a fronte dei cambiamenti in atto in tutte le attività economiche , vista la crescente perdita di peso del settore agricolo tra le varie fonti di reddito della società rurale .\n",
      "Questo aspetto , insieme alle carenze delle reti di infrastrutture e servizi e a un ' offerta di lavoro in generale molto ridotta e al massimo stagionale e poco diversificata , accentua l ' esodo dalle zone rurali .\n",
      "Le conseguenze sono evidenti .\n",
      "Ad andarsene sono i giovani , quelli che acquisiscono una formazione e trovano un impiego al di fuori delle aree rurali , e ciò si ripercuote negativamente su di esse .\n",
      "La mancanza di infrastrutture costituisce un ostacolo anche per l ' insediamento di imprese e per la creazione di posti di lavoro .\n",
      "Non dobbiamo dimenticare che lo spazio rurale rappresenta quasi i quattro quinti del territorio dell ' Unione europea .\n",
      "L ' agricoltura fornisce solo il 5,5 percento dell ' occupazione dell ' Unione stessa .\n",
      "Inoltre , tre quarti dei nostri agricoltori lavorano part-time e hanno bisogno di integrare efficacemente il loro reddito .\n",
      "Per questo motivo , tra gli obiettivi fondamentali che dovremmo prefiggerci nell ' Unione europea figura l ' impegno a creare nuovi posti di lavoro nelle zone rurali , al di fuori del settore agricolo , in settori quali il turismo rurale , lo sport , la cultura , il restauro del patrimonio , la fondazione e trasformazione di imprese , le nuove tecnologie , i servizi , ecc .\n",
      "Ciò nonostante , pur non essendo esclusivo il ruolo dell ' agricoltura , resta indispensabile per evitare la disintegrazione economica e sociale delle aree rurali e la creazione di altre città fantasma , se non altro anche perché gli agricoltori svolgono un ruolo fondamentale nella gestione del territorio , la conservazione della biodiversità e la tutela dell ' ambiente .\n",
      "Quindi siamo a favore di una politica agricola e di sviluppo rurale coerente con gli obiettivi segnalati ; alle soglie del XXI secolo le zone rurali devono essere competitive e multifunzionali sia sotto l ' aspetto agricolo che aprendosi alla diversità delle attività non agricole .\n",
      "E ' importante privilegiare criteri generali di assetto del territorio e di equilibrio della popolazione , e tenere conto delle conclusioni della commissione per l' agricoltura e lo sviluppo rurale relative a cinque aspetti fondamentali , riprese solo in parte dalla commissione per i trasporti , la politica regionale e il turismo nei punti 16 e 17 .\n",
      "Concludendo , chiedo alla Commissione di tenere conto di questi cinque punti quando si tratterà di definire le conclusioni relative ai quattro pilastri ; ritengo infatti che per l ' Unione europea la permanenza della popolazione nell ' ambiente rurale debba essere uno degli obiettivi prioritari .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , desidero innanzi tutto ringraziare la relatrice onorevole Schroedter per il lavoro svolto , a mio parere , egregiamente .\n",
      "La ringrazio inoltre per la disponibilità al dialogo che ha dimostrato nei confronti degli altri gruppi politici , quando si è trattato di trovare formulazioni di compromesso di fronte alla valanga di emendamenti , forse più numerosi del previsto , ma che in realtà segnalano la rilevanza della relazione in discussione .\n",
      "Per noi è importante che le conclusioni approvate alla fine in quest ' Aula siano tenute in considerazione dalla Commissione , quanto meno nello spirito , perché a questo punto potrebbe sembrare che qui stiamo portando avanti un esercizio inutile , puramente retorico .\n",
      "La verità è che siamo convinti , e ciò si riflette anche nel testo delle conclusioni , che la Commissione debba tenere conto delle decisioni di questo Parlamento , soprattutto in vista della revisione delle linee direttrici a metà periodo .\n",
      "Nei nostri emendamenti abbiamo ribadito l ' importanza di stabilire sinergie tra i Fondi strutturali , il Fondo di coesione e le iniziative comunitarie , in modo che la loro applicazione porti , nel modo migliore e più redditizio , all ' eliminazione progressiva delle disuguaglianze tra regioni e alla creazione di posti di lavoro le quali , in definitiva , sono i due scopi fondamentali dei Fondi di cui stiamo parlando .\n",
      "Per imprimere un impulso più rapido ed efficace nel conseguimento di tali obiettivi , riteniamo che all ' iniziativa debbano partecipare i creatori di posti di lavoro , i veri creatori di imprese e coloro che garantiscono effettivamente nuove fonti di occupazione , ovvero gli imprenditori .\n",
      "Soprattutto i piccoli e medi imprenditori devono partecipare alla distribuzione di questi fondi .\n",
      "Altrimenti , se si sentono emarginati , se non possono partecipare , non dico soltanto alla fruizione ma anche alla ricezione di questi fondi , avremo perso un ' occasione di conseguire i nostri obiettivi più velocemente .\n",
      "Inoltre , per raggiungere i nostri obiettivi , per riuscire a superare le disuguaglianze tra regioni e trovare fonti di lavoro è importante scommettere decisamente a favore delle nuove tecnologie , le reti di trasporto e di comunicazione e le energie rinnovabili .\n",
      "Tutto questo , sottolineo , avvalendosi della partecipazione dell ' impresa privata , che unendo il proprio impegno a quello delle amministrazioni pubbliche , in una sinergia di completamento che non comporti mai chiusure o esclusioni , creerà ricchezza sociale e posti di lavoro .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , sento il dovere di ricordare al mio collega , onorevole Evans il vero motivo per cui il Galles ha ottenuto lo status di regione dell' obiettivo 1 : è stato a causa delle sciagurate politiche del suo partito conservatore .\n",
      "E mi permetto di ricordargli anche che , mentre era Segretario di Stato per il Galles , il leader del suo partito , Hague , ha violato tutte le regole sull ' addizionalità e per questo ricevuto una dura lettera del Commissario Wulf-Mathies sui requisiti normativi .\n",
      "Posso dirvi che il governo britannico è consapevole dei suoi obblighi relativi all ' addizionalità per l' obiettivo 1 .\n",
      "Suggerisco all' onorevole Evans di andare a leggersi il regolamento .\n",
      "Il mio gruppo ha presentato innumerevoli emendamenti ad ambedue le relazioni in discussione oggi .\n",
      "Vorrei che ci concentrassimo sul ruolo essenziale delle linee direttrici , nella fattispecie fornire un quadro e uno strumento per sostenere e incrementare la ripresa economica , per garantire l' uso più efficiente possibile delle risorse nell' ambito di un' ampia collaborazione e riportare queste regioni sulla strada del recupero e dello sviluppo sostenibile in modo che alla fine non abbiano più bisogno di essere tenute in vita artificialmente .\n",
      "E ' importante identificare le capacità e il potenziale delle nostre regioni nel settore dell ' alta tecnologia , , soprattutto alla luce delle notizie diffuse dai mezzi di comunicazione , secondo cui l' Europa starebbe rapidamente perdendo terreno a favore degli Stati Uniti per quanto attiene alla crescita delle industrie ad alto contenuto tecnologico , determinanti per il futuro .\n",
      "Anche il funzionamento del precedente gruppo di programmi è molto istruttivo , in quanto ci dice quale non dovrebbe essere il ruolo delle linee direttrici .\n",
      "Non dovrebbero essere volte a creare nuovi livelli di burocrazia e formalità , né a spostare le priorità e le politiche a metà dello sviluppo di un progetto , con la conseguenza di inevitabili ritardi e sottoutilizzo dei fondi , particolarmente alla luce dei nuovi requisiti di bilancio .\n",
      "L' attuazione e la gestione delle linee direttrici non possono essere lasciate alla personale interpretazione di un qualsiasi funzionario della Commissione o dell' amministrazione nazionale .\n",
      "L' operato della direzione generale della Commissione deve essere coerente , sempre nel rispetto degli aspetti locali e regionali specifici dei programmi della Commissione .\n",
      "In conclusione , le linee direttrici devono essere ampie , indicative e flessibili , per fornire assistenza ai gestori dei programmi e ai beneficiari dei fondi e per sfruttare al massimo il potenziale dei nostri nuovi ambiti di recupero .\n",
      "Se riusciremo a imprimere uno spirito di imprenditorialità alle regioni povere e strutturalmente deboli , alla fine riusciremo a rimetterle in carreggiata perché possano attirare sufficiente fiducia da parte degli investitori , elemento chiave per il successo futuro .\n",
      "E ' in questa luce che giudicheremo il successo delle linee direttrici in parola : vedremo se la politica regionale UE , con linee direttrici valide , solide e di supporto , sarà in grado di creare nuove opportunità e di permettere alle regioni povere e strutturalmente deboli di svolgere appieno il loro ruolo e contribuire alla crescita e alla prosperità dell' UE .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , desidero prima di tutto ringraziare la onorevole Schroedter per l' ottima relazione .\n",
      "Ha svolto un' analisi dettagliata di questo argomento e ha inserito molti emendamenti proposti in sede di commissione .\n",
      "La relatrice ha inoltre giustamente sottolineato che il Parlamento non è stato ascoltato per tempo in merito alle direttive .\n",
      "Adesso siamo già molto in ritardo .\n",
      "Speriamo che il parere del Parlamento sia di aiuto per la valutazione intermedia dei programmi e per la loro realizzazione .\n",
      "Rispetto ai tempi impiegati , la relazione è cresciuta a dismisura durante il dibattito .\n",
      "Sono stati inseriti numerosissimi dettagli , che erano emersi già nelle relazioni precedenti .\n",
      "A questo punto penso sia più importante concentrarsi nella valutazione dei processi ed in che modo questi potranno permettere di gestire la politica regionale dell' Unione , ricordando che l' obiettivo che si desidera raggiungere è quello di ridurre la disuguaglianza locale .\n",
      "Il mio gruppo ribadisce l' importanza del principio di responsabilità degli Stati membri e del ruolo degli attori locali in merito allo sviluppo e all' attuazione dei programmi .\n",
      "A tal proposito , sarebbe estremamente importante coinvolgere le piccole e medie imprese .\n",
      "Il mio gruppo ritiene inoltre importante tenere maggiormente in considerazione le isole e le regioni periferiche e promuovere il dialogo tra il mondo urbano e quello rurale .\n",
      "Ci opponiamo all' eccessivo controllo dell' Unione europea e dei governi centrali dei paesi membri e chiediamo che venga ridotta la burocrazia , che fa rallentare lo sviluppo e lo svolgimento dei programmi .\n",
      "L' efficacia dei progetti , perseguiti con il sostegnoo dell' Unione , è stata spesso ridotta a causa della lentezza dei processi decisionali e della complessità amministrativa .\n",
      "Spesso sono stati finanziati progetti che non hanno prodotto alcun vantaggio permanente alla regione interessata .\n",
      "I progetti dovrebbero essere più efficienti , più flessibili ed in grado di garantire risultati migliori .\n",
      "Durante la preparazione della relazione è stato interessante discutere dei temi generali relativi alla politica regionale dell' Unione europea .\n",
      "Per noi , nuovi deputati al Parlamento , questa è stata la prima volta , e devo ammettere che è ho seguito i lavori con estremo interesse .\n",
      "Questa relazione è ottima e gode del sostegno del nostro gruppo . Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , la prova che questo Parlamento resta tuttora un ' Istituzione consultiva e subordinata è data dall ' impossibilità per l ' eccellente relazione della collega del mio gruppo , onorevole Elisabeth Schroedter , di approdare in seduta plenaria , perché i piani di sviluppo regionale per il periodo 2000-2006 per le zone dell ' obiettivo 1 già da diversi mesi giacciono negli uffici della Commissione .\n",
      "Tenendo conto di questo , la nostra Assemblea deve esigere , in ogni caso , che prima della loro approvazione i Quadri comunitari di sostegno per il suddetto periodo siano esaminati e discussi in questo Parlamento proprio alla luce degli orientamenti presentati oggi , poiché riteniamo che abbiano la particolare capacità di creare occupazione nei territori più poveri o meno sviluppati , consentendoci così di contribuire a invertire le tendenze negative che determinano le sperequazioni esistenti nella società europea e di avanzare verso un ' Europa più giusta .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , non dovremmo dimenticare che l ' obiettivo principale e strategico dei Fondi strutturali e di coesione , nonché del loro coordinamento , è conseguire la coesione economica e sociale .\n",
      "Noi siamo tenuti a contribuire all ' elaborazione delle linee direttrici e anche alla valutazione dei risultati .\n",
      "E ciò perché siamo i rappresentanti dei cittadini nell ' Europa dei cittadini e non solo in un ' Europa degli Stati e delle regioni .\n",
      "Vediamo che i Fondi sono una condizione necessaria , ma non sufficiente , per raggiungere la coesione economica e sociale .\n",
      "Se prendiamo come indicatore unico il prodotto interno lordo per abitante , possiamo anche sbagliarci .\n",
      "Alcuni colleghi hanno già parlato della disoccupazione e del calo demografico .\n",
      "Dovremo analizzare una serie di indicatori che ci permettano di valutare la condizione e l ' evoluzione delle società regionali che versano in situazioni peggiori di altre .\n",
      "Da alcune relazioni presentate oggi in Plenaria , emerge chiaramente che le 25 regioni europee più prospere hanno una disoccupazione di cinque volte inferiore a quella delle 25 regioni meno prospere .\n",
      "Ciò impone al Parlamento europeo , al signor Commissario e alla Commissione di intervenire in maniera risoluta e strategica .\n",
      "E ' vero che il Parlamento europeo non ha avuto l ' occasione - o non gli è stata concessa , perché era la fine della legislatura - di discutere delle linee direttrici .\n",
      "Non credo però che la relazione arrivi tardi .\n",
      "Occorre una riflessione collettiva per poter rivedere e valutare correttamente i nuovi programmi dell ' obiettivo 1 e i piani di sviluppo regionale elaborati prima dell ' entrata in vigore delle linee direttrici .\n",
      "I programmi dei vari obiettivi vanno coordinati .\n",
      "Siamo tutti d ' accordo nel chiedere che il Parlamento possa essere compartecipe della valutazione delle linee direttrici a metà periodo di funzionamento dei programmi , visto che siamo i rappresentanti dei cittadini .\n",
      "I cittadini non possono accettare che l ' Unione europea prenda decisioni in modo , almeno in apparenza , burocratico .\n",
      "Hanno bisogno che funzioni la dimensione politica , che sussistano responsabilità , che si comunichi con loro .\n",
      "Questo è quanto chiediamo oggi al signor Commissario .\n",
      "Spero che sarà d ' accordo , alla luce della sua precedente esperienza di presidente di regione , nel proporre alcuni indicatori insieme a una strategia a favore della coesione economica e sociale e non soltanto della produttività .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , appoggio le principali proposte della relazione sulla gestione dei Fondi strutturali e del Fondo di coesione per il periodo 2000-2006 e le sue principali raccomandazioni , fra cui quella secondo cui l' approccio relativo alla spesa dei Fondi strutturali e del Fondo di coesione deve sempre essere integrato , il che significa che occorre sviluppare un forte partenariato fra le autorità locali e i governi nazionali in relazione all' utilizzo di tali finanziamenti .\n",
      "Gli Stati membri sono chiamati ad attribuire maggiore importanza alle strategie integrate volte a rivitalizzare i rapporti fra le città e le aree rurali .\n",
      "Si tratta di un aspetto di particolare rilievo poiché , per quanto il rinnovamento urbano sia vitale , nelle nostre politiche dobbiamo sempre trovare un equilibrio fra la promozione dello sviluppo rurale e il miglioramento delle condizioni di vita degli abitanti dei centri urbani se non vogliamo costruire un' Europa fatta solo di città .\n",
      "I Fondi strutturali hanno svolto un ruolo chiave nello sviluppo delle aree sia urbane che rurali dei paesi periferici , principalmente con il miglioramento del sistema viario , dei sistemi di trattamento delle acquee reflue e delle reti di trasporto connesse .\n",
      "Tale processo continuerà in linea con gli orientamenti di spesa fissati dai Capi di Stato e di governo dell' UE l' anno scorso al Vertice di Berlino e accolti favorevolmente dal Parlamento nella tornata di maggio .\n",
      "Non vi è dubbio che i principali programmi UE attuati fra il 1989 , il 1993 , il 1994 e il 1999 abbiano contribuito a migliorare la competitività economica dei paesi periferici e delle regioni dell' obiettivo 1 .\n",
      "L' essenziale adesso è consolidare i progressi fatti finora e renderli irreversibili , in modo da garantire che i paesi periferici e le regioni ultraperiferiche , le regioni più deboli in Europa , possano operare con successo sia nella nuova zona dell' euro che nel mercato unico , che è in continua espansione e in cui la libera circolazione di merci , persone , servizi e capitali è ormai una realtà .\n",
      "Infine , sebbene a partire dal Fondo europeo di sviluppo regionale e dal Fondo di coesione siano stati finanziati progetti infrastrutturali essenziali , non dovremmo dimenticare che il Fondo sociale europeo ha svolto un ruolo importantissimo nell' assistere i meno abbienti nella nostra società .\n",
      "Grazie al Fondo sociale abbiamo potuto migliorare i nostri organismi di terzo livello , finanziare i nostri programmi per i giovani che lasciano la scuola e realizzare vaste iniziative per la lotta alla disoccupazione giovanile e di lunga durata , per aiutare chi abbandona la scuola in giovane età e promuovere livelli più elevati di istruzione fra gli adulti .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , in passato mi sono trovato più volte in disaccordo con la relatrice in merito al suo approccio a problemi di politica regionale , ma questa volta debbo invece dirmi d' accordo con lei .\n",
      "Non so se questo la incoraggerà a proseguire nella stessa direzione , ma vorrei comunque rivolgerle le mie congratulazioni .\n",
      "La seconda osservazione che vorrei fare è che avremmo preferito , come avevamo richiesto la onorevole McCarthy e io in qualità di relatori per il regolamento generale , che le linee direttrici fossero inserite nel regolamento come allegato .\n",
      "Purtroppo così non è stato e la responsabilità non è certo dell' onorevole Bernié ; era una questione di competenza della precedente Commissione .\n",
      "Lo faccio rilevare per ribadire nuovamente la posizione del Parlamento .\n",
      "La terza osservazione che desidero formulare è che , naturalmente , le linee direttrici ci trovano sostanzialmente d' accordo , nella misura in cui non si discostano dalle osservazioni che avevamo formulato a suo tempo .\n",
      "Rappresentano un notevole ausilio per gli Stati membri , ma in particolare mi preme evidenziare l' enfasi data dalla Commissione allo sviluppo sostenibile , all' incremento dell' occupazione , con particolare riguardo alle pari opportunità , al settore dei trasporti .\n",
      "Parlando a titolo personale , posso dirmi completamente d' accordo .\n",
      "Ciò detto , tuttavia , da isolano quale sono tengo a denunciare la scarsa attenzione prestata alla problematica dello sviluppo insulare .\n",
      "Non vi viene infatti attribuita la dovuta attenzione , e non è la prima volta che ciò accade : si tratta di una lunga storia , che si trascina almeno da quando sono stato eletto al Parlamento , cinque anni fa , tant' è vero che ho già trattato questo argomento a più riprese .\n",
      "E continueremo a doverlo trattare , signor Commissario , perché l' articolo 158 , paragrafo 1 del Trattato di Amsterdam contiene una disposizione che allude a una politica integrata per le isole .\n",
      "Di conseguenza , la Commissione dovrà finalmente prendere in esame questo preciso argomento .\n",
      "Ora , signor Commissario , è finalmente giunto il momento di applicare i programmi : pertanto , gli Stati membri dovranno a loro volta farsi carico delle proprie responsabilità ed eseguire adeguatamente i propri compiti .\n",
      "Quanto al Parlamento , tengo a ricordare che esiste un codice di buona condotta sottoscritto fra Commissione e Parlamento lo scorso mese di maggio .\n",
      "Sono del tutto certo che quel codice sarà rispettato e che il Parlamento sarà tenuto al corrente dell' evoluzione in atto e di ogni dettaglio sull' applicazione dei programmi .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , nel minuto e mezzo di parola a mia disposizione vorrei innanzi tutto congratularmi con la onorevole Schroedter .\n",
      "Molti altri lo hanno già fatto , ma lo merita davvero per la grande apertura e attenzione che ha dimostrato per le diverse proposte presentate dai colleghi ; credo che la sua disponibilità abbia conferito alla sua relazione la qualità che quest ' oggi le riconosciamo .\n",
      "Mi associo al rammarico espresso dalla nostra relatrice per il fatto che il Parlamento in un certo senso si sia trovato a salire su un treno già in corsa ; la procedura negoziale sulle linee direttrici con gli Stati membri è infatti tanto avanzata da non consentirci di ritenere che la relazione possa produrre un impatto immediato , e me ne dispiace .\n",
      "Mi pare , pertanto , che la relazione debba invece anticipare e delineare le linee direttrici della revisione intermedia del 2003 e addirittura influenzare la seconda fase di programmazione successiva al 2003 .\n",
      "In pratica intendo dire che stiamo per entrare in un periodo di gestione della programmazione 2000-2006 che non dovrà essere un periodo di routine per un semplice motivo : dobbiamo raccogliere due grandi sfide .\n",
      "La prima è l ' armonizzazione delle politiche di gestione del territorio nazionale e delle politiche di sviluppo regionale .\n",
      "Le sovvenzioni non bastano per costruire lo sviluppo se le infrastrutture e i servizi pubblici sono carenti .\n",
      "Occorre dunque porsi una questione di fondo : come articolare la politica dell ' Unione con le politiche nazionali sussidiarie di gestione del territorio .\n",
      "La seconda sfida consiste nell ' ampliamento , che ovviamente comporterà conseguenze significative sia in termini di bilancio che geografici .\n",
      "Ecco due piste di riflessione che suggerisco al Commissario e sulle quali lo invito a coinvolgerci .\n",
      "Concludendo , in un periodo di catastrofi naturali come quello che stiamo attraversando , mi preme evocare il problema dell ' utilizzo dei Fondi strutturali .\n",
      "E ' noto che spetta agli Stati membri ridistribuire una parte dei finanziamenti .\n",
      "Diversamente da quanto tendenzialmente vorrebbero gli Stati membri l ' Europa non dovrebbe sparire completamente .\n",
      "Al giorno d ' oggi l ' opinione pubblica e la stampa ci accusano di essere latitanti laddove invece siamo noi a finanziare gran parte delle iniziative nazionali .\n",
      "Credo che dovremmo essere capaci di dirlo chiaro e forte .\n",
      "Ritengo che sarebbe altrettanto opportuno istituire o chiedere agli Stati membri di garantire l ' informazione sugli aiuti europei ogni qualvolta questi siano utilizzati per porre rimedio ai danni causati da catastrofi naturali o incidenti .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , la priorità attribuita ai criteri finanziari e monetari rafforza il dilagare delle ineguaglianze di ogni genere .\n",
      "Per gli esperti del piano francese , lo scenario oggi più plausibile è l ' approfondirsi del divario tra le regioni all ' interno di ogni paese .\n",
      "I Fondi strutturali hanno contribuito proprio a frenare tale processo .\n",
      "Il nostro progetto di un ' Europa protesa a soddisfare i bisogni sociali mira a ottenere una convergenza verso l ' alto delle condizioni di vita : realizzarlo comporterebbe indubbiamente estendere gli strumenti di ridistribuzione delle risorse , quali appunto i Fondi strutturali .\n",
      "Nella fattispecie noi proponiamo un ' imposta unificata sul patrimonio che consentirebbe di alimentare fondi destinati alle misure di accompagnamento per armonizzare i sistemi di previdenza sociale e la riduzione dell ' orario di lavoro a livello europeo .\n",
      "Ebbene , la Commissione , che sarebbe tenuta a presentare le linee direttrici , ha assolto a tale compito in modo vago e poco convinto .\n",
      "La relazione in discussione quest ' oggi ridà alla politica il ruolo che le spetta , compiendo un passo verso una politica dell ' occupazione e dello sviluppo sostenibile .\n",
      "E ' per questi motivi che voteremo a favore .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , anch' io mi voglio complimentare con il relatore per l' ottimo lavoro svolto .\n",
      "Credo che nei prossimi anni più che mai , di fronte alla sfida della globalizzazione e a quella dell' ampliamento ad Est , l' Europa abbia bisogno di indicazioni adeguate e precise per la programmazione e il rilancio della sua economia .\n",
      "In tal senso , l' Europa nel suo complesso , e ciascuno Stato membro in particolare , dovrà utilizzare al meglio tutte le sue risorse e le sue potenzialità , quindi anche i Fondi strutturali disponibili .\n",
      "Per fare ciò c' è bisogno di una Commissione europea che , al di là delle buone intenzioni , dia maggiore chiarezza alle sue linee direttrici e si impegni al massimo in un' opera di controllo sull' impegno di queste risorse da parte degli Stati membri .\n",
      "L' Italia , ad esempio , negli ultimi anni ha avuto problemi nell' utilizzo dei Fondi strutturali , soprattutto a causa di un' eccessiva burocrazia , di un' informazione carente e dello scarso coinvolgimento degli operatori economici e sociali a livello locale .\n",
      "Sono quindi due i punti su cui vorrei richiamare l' attenzione della Commissione : in primo luogo , occorre utilizzare al meglio la concertazione come metodo di coordinamento e di partecipazione alle decisioni da parte di tutti gli operatori locali e regionali , proprio per evitare squilibri e diseguaglianze ; in secondo luogo , occorre un' autentica opera di semplificazione e trasparenza dei processi amministrativi , che troppo spesso sono inutilmente lunghi e complessi al punto da pregiudicare l' accesso ai Fondi , cosa di cui si lamentano soprattutto le piccole e medie imprese europee .\n",
      "Concludo , signor Presidente , dicendo che è piuttosto grave che nella comunicazione della Commissione sia stata riservata una scarsa attenzione ai patti territoriali e soprattutto alle modalità di lotta alla disoccupazione femminile e giovanile .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , alla stessa stregua dell' onorevole Evans , è per me un piacere particolare potermi alzare in piedi per il mio primo intervento in questo Parlamento durante la discussione di un tema di tale importanza , specialmente dato che rappresento le West Midlands , una regione del Regno Unito che finora ha beneficiato dei finanziamenti riservati all' obiettivo 2 .\n",
      "Tuttavia , la relazione in oggetto stasera è un esempio lampante di come , se non siamo molto cauti , possiamo partorire idee che paiono grandiose , ma che invece sono prive di consistenza e quindi si rivelano inutili per chi dovrebbe trarne immediatamente profitto .\n",
      "L' intento della relazione è buono ma , come spesso succede quando trattiamo di questi temi , i suoi obiettivi non sono chiaramente definiti e manca di una base solida che la possa rendere di una qualche utilità .\n",
      "Per questo il motivo il mio gruppo e io proponiamo tre emendamenti e aggiunte sostanziali al testo , volti non tanto a togliere qualcosa alla proposta , ma a renderla più pertinente per coloro ai quali deve servire da guida .\n",
      "Tengo a illustrare qual è il nostro ragionamento .\n",
      "Primo , vogliamo garantire che le risorse dei Fondi strutturali e del Fondo di coesione siano utilizzate in modo adeguato .\n",
      "L' esperienza passata ci insegna che noi , in quanto rappresentanti eletti dei contribuenti europei , dobbiamo esigere probità e trasparenza finanziaria negli esborsi e il controllo di questi fondi .\n",
      "Pertanto i nostri emendamenti e aggiunte sono volti a reperire indicatori di redditività nel processo di concessione e di spesa dei fondi .\n",
      "Secondo , troppo spesso ingenti somme di denaro vengono spese per progetti i cui risultati all' inizio della programmazione sono inevitabilmente vaghi .\n",
      "Ma a metà o alla fine di tale periodo non esiste un modo efficace per interrompere un progetto che rivelatosi inutile .\n",
      "Pertanto le nostre aggiunte chiedono di prevedere strategie di interruzione attuabili in pratica , cosicché non solo ci sia la necessaria garanzia in relazione alle spese correnti , spesso riversate sul contribuente , ma che si possa altresì evitare la sindrome ben nota per cui si continua a spendere denaro per portare avanti un progetto che si è già dimostrato un fallimento .\n",
      "Infine , chiediamo che si cambino metodi e rapporti usati per l' esborso dei fondi .\n",
      "Occorre un maggiore coinvolgimento del settore privato , che introdurrà una prospettiva di realismo finanziario nel progetto di finanziamento .\n",
      "Inoltre , va cambiato il tipo di progetti che vengono finanziati .\n",
      "Basta progetti su scala ridotta che mirano solo al reddito , e che sono difficili da controllare , occorre invece passare a progetti su vasta scala , i cui benefici nella maggior parte dei casi sono evidenti .\n",
      "In tal modo si farà fronte alla necessità di trasparenza nell' uso di queste risorse , di cui si fa un gran parlare , contrastando al contempo la tentazione di tirare inutilmente per le lunghe continuando ad assorbire i soldi dei contribuenti locali nelle aree in cui sono localizzati i progetti in questione , mentre il Parlamento europeo darà prova di prendere molto sul serio il bisogno di riforma .\n",
      "Se oggi l' Aula appoggerà le modifiche alla relazione che ho illustrato , credo che riusciremo a passare alla fase successiva , cioè raggiungere gli obiettivi storici per i quali i Fondi sono stati costituiti , cioè fornire assistenza - in modo finanziariamente sostenibile - alle aree povere dell' Unione europea che necessitano di un livello di vita dignitoso , non tanto facendo loro l' elemosina ma dando loro una spinta in avanti .\n",
      "Invito l' Aula a votare a favore delle modifiche che ho presentato .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , desidero a mia volta congratularmi con la relatrice per il lavoro svolto , un lavoro serio e completo .\n",
      "Non v' è dubbio che le politiche strutturali e la politica di coesione dell' Unione europea rappresentino gli strumenti essenziali per creare condizioni atte allo sviluppo e alla riduzione delle sperequazioni economiche e sociali fra le varie regioni , dal momento che le disparità , nonostante gli sforzi compiuti , restano elevate , e inammissibilmente elevate nell' ambito della disoccupazione .\n",
      "Per garantire un maggiore conseguimento degli obiettivi di queste politiche , è indispensabile assicurarne il coordinamento e l' organizzazione sulla base di linee direttrici messe a punto con attenzione e , mi si consenta , con intelligenza .\n",
      "Non va dimenticato che queste politiche , quando sono efficaci , risultano visibili anche agli occhi del cittadino europeo che ne trae un beneficio , che tocca con mano un miglioramento diretto nella propria qualità della vita .\n",
      "Non va neppure dimenticato che occorrerà prestare particolare attenzione alle aree insulari e ultraperiferiche dell' Unione , che si scontrano con enormi ostacoli al proprio sviluppo economico e sociale dovuti appunto alla posizione geografica ; sempre che , naturalmente , la Commissione non abbia intenzione di costruire ponti e di scavare tunnel sottomarini per collegarle al resto del continente .\n",
      "In conclusione , desidero sottolineare che le politiche strutturali nel loro complesso necessitano di maggiore flessibilità , onde potersi adattare più agevolmente al mutare delle circostanze , potendo così far fronte alle nuove sfide e opportunità comportate dall' avvento del nuovo millennio , per il quale tutti noi ci auguriamo il meglio .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , indubbiamente la relazione dell ' onorevole Schroedter contiene numerose osservazioni utili e mi congratulo con lei , ma resto del parere che , dinanzi agli orientamenti e ai risultati della politica regionale della Comunità , la nostra inquietudine dovrebbe essere anche maggiore .\n",
      "In poche parole , la colossale disoccupazione di massa non soltanto non viene attenuata dalla politica regionale , ma ne risulta addirittura ulteriormente aggravata .\n",
      "L' economia rurale e le regioni agricole vengono infatti colpite in modo irrimediabile da questa politica , con conseguenze drammatiche sia per l' occupazione nelle aree rurali , sia per il livello di vita degli agricoltori , soprattutto nel meridione europeo .\n",
      "All' interno degli Stati membri , le disparità regionali si approfondiscono pericolosamente .\n",
      "Basta soffermarsi sui dati contenuti nella sesta relazione periodica per rendersi conto della forte accelerazione registrata negli ultimi dieci anni dalle sperequazioni regionali .\n",
      "L' attenzione dedicata ai colossali problemi delle aree insulari dell' Unione è risibile , quando non addirittura inesistente , proprio mentre le carenze infrastrutturali in termini di trasporti , comunicazioni ed energia condannano queste aree alla desolazione .\n",
      "Di questo stato di cose è responsabile non soltanto la politica regionale , ma anche le politiche economiche e sociali attuate in generale dall' Unione .\n",
      "Vasti strati di popolazione condannano senza mezzi termini queste politiche come pericolose e repressive .\n",
      "Purtroppo , le nuove linee direttrici non segnano alcun cambiamento di rotta e nulla lascia ipotizzare che , con la loro applicazione , qualcosa possa mai cambiare .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , onorevoli colleghi , mi sia consentito intervenire brevemente per evidenziare due punti delle relazioni in esame , i quali rivestono un ' importanza strategica essenziale nella nostra visione dell ' Unione .\n",
      "Il primo attiene all ' importanza imprescindibile e centrale che continuiamo ad attribuire alla coesione economica e sociale .\n",
      "Ci preoccupano , pertanto , le voci secondo cui l ' importanza di tale obiettivo starebbe scemando nelle considerazioni della Commissione .\n",
      "Noi continuiamo a pensare che la coesione economica e sociale sia un obiettivo centrale dell ' Unione .\n",
      "Il secondo mi trova d ' accordo con i commenti espressi da un collega sulla questione delle isole , e vorrei attirare l ' attenzione sulle regioni ultraperiferiche .\n",
      "In futuro vorremmo poter constatare maggiore coraggio nel trattamento delle questioni concernenti le regioni ultraperiferiche come , nel caso del mio paese , le isole Azzorre e Madera .\n",
      "Colgo quest ' occasione per chiedere alla Commissione di spiegarci le ragioni del ritardo della sua relazione sulle regioni ultraperiferiche che il Parlamento attende ormai da molto tempo .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , ringrazio innanzi tutto la relatrice anche per la disponibilità ad accogliere i nostri suggerimenti nella relazione .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , onorevoli colleghi , signor Commissario , le linee direttrici sono intese a fornire agli Stati membri un orientamento per il raggiungimento degli obiettivi di riforma nel quadro della programmazione .\n",
      "Tuttavia , contrariamente alla pretesa di fornire orientamenti , le indicazioni della Commissione in merito rappresentano piuttosto un catalogo di possibili misure nel quadro dei vari settori di intervento .\n",
      "Il loro senso originario sarebbe invece quello di indicare la direzione e le priorità .\n",
      "Condivido l' opinione della relatrice secondo la quale il documento della Commissione contiene purtroppo raccomandazioni insufficienti agli Stati membri affinché procedano alla semplificazione amministrativa .\n",
      "Sottoscrivo anche le richieste di concentrare l' attenzione nel corso dei negoziati con gli Stati membri su ambiti quali la promozione di un ambiente favorevole per le piccole e medie imprese ad elevata intensità di manodopera , fissando obiettivi chiari a favore della creazione di fonti alternative di finanziamento , ivi compresi i programmi in materia di capitale di rischio e finanziamento privato , i servizi di sostegno alle nuove imprese nonché alle nuove tecnologie dell' informazione e agli investimenti in settori innovativi .\n",
      "Appoggio in particolare un emendamento presentato dal gruppo politico al quale appartengo al punto 10 , volto ad assicurare un' adeguata partecipazione da parte del settore privato alla programmazione ed esecuzione dei progetti .\n",
      "Sarei lieto , onorevole Schroedter , se lei inserisse anche questo emendamento , conformemente al principio di sussidiarietà , fra le sue positive considerazioni .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , il criterio unanime che abbiamo seguito in sede di commissione per l ' occupazione e gli affari sociali è l ' appoggio agli interventi dei Fondi strutturali e di coesione che operano per dare migliori possibilità di impiego ai disoccupati e per la parità uomo donna che rivestiva un carattere strategico e prioritario .\n",
      "Purtroppo l ' ottima relazione Schroedter ha trascurato questo criterio , nonostante le molteplici prove , come vedremo in seguito nella relazione Berend , di come in realtà questi Fondi stiano aiutando meravigliosamente le regioni più arretrate a colmare la distanza che le separa dalle regioni più sviluppate d ' Europa .\n",
      "Stanno crescendo , ma a livello di PIL .\n",
      "Stanno crescendo in termini di competitività , ma non tutti possono godere della crescita della ricchezza , perché non aumenta l ' occupazione e permane un divario nelle opportunità occupazionali tra le varie regioni .\n",
      "Signor Commissario , legga il parere della commissione per l ' occupazione e gli affari sociali e gli attribuisca priorità , perché questo è il grande problema dei cittadini .\n",
      "E nella revisione , nell ' assegnazione delle riserve , tenga conto del carattere strategico delle esigenze occupazionali ; , in definitiva , questo è quanto richiedono i Fondi strutturali e di coesione .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , le linee direttrici devono essere in grado di orientare opportunamente e di rafforzare l' efficacia dei programmi per il delicato settennio compreso fra il 2000 e il 2006 , in modo che possano finalmente divenire realtà lo sviluppo sostenibile , la crescita dell' occupazione con particolare riferimento alle donne e ai giovani , e in modo da garantire un equilibrio tra politica economica , politica sociale e politica ambientale .\n",
      "Acquisisce particolare importanza la risposta da dare ai sempre più gravi problemi delle aree urbane , la salvaguardia dell' occupazione nelle aree rurali , il sostegno da assicurare alle regioni agricole e , naturalmente , le pari opportunità di sviluppo per le aree insulari dell' Unione europea e per le isole greche - che sono la metà delle isole d' Europa - come previsto dall' articolo 158 del Trattato .\n",
      "La politica di coesione va ulteriormente rafforzata , in quanto un' Europa caratterizzata da eccessive disparità nel livello di vita delle varie regioni non può essere ritenuta affidabile né sostenibile .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , onorevoli parlamentari , desidero innanzi tutto sottolineare con quanto interesse ho ascoltato attentamente le osservazioni , talvolta le critiche e i suggerimenti formulati da coloro che sono intervenuti nella discussione sulla relazione della onorevole Schroedter .\n",
      "Onorevole relatrice , onorevoli parlamentari , tutti siamo consapevoli dei motivi e delle scadenze - su questo tornerò tra un attimo - e a prescindere da tali scadenze o ritardi , posto che la discussione sulla relazione si tiene adesso , a nome della Commissione ritengo che tale discussione cada al momento opportuno , trattandosi delle linee direttrici per il 2000-2006 , in quanto la nuova programmazione regionale si avvia proprio ora .\n",
      "Onorevole relatrice , lei ha ricordato a giusto titolo che , per quanto la definizione delle priorità in materia di sviluppo spetti in primis agli Stati membri e alle regioni , il cofinanziamento dei programmi tramite l ' Unione europea esige e giustifica che si tenga egualmente conto delle priorità comunitarie dibattute e approvate in questa sede , al fine di promuovere la dimensione comunitaria della coesione economica e sociale cui molti di voi si sono richiamati con forza .\n",
      "Inoltre , onorevoli parlamentari , desidero soffermarmi un momento sul ruolo e la struttura delle linee direttrici , prima di passare alle principali osservazioni e critiche formulate dalla relatrice o dagli onorevoli parlamentari .\n",
      "In merito al ruolo e alla struttura delle linee direttrici , il presidente della commissione competente , onorevole Hatzidakis , la relatrice e la onorevole McCarthy hanno ricordato che esse sono intese ad assistere le autorità nazionali e regionali nella preparazione della strategia di programmazione per gli obiettivi nn .\n",
      "1 , 2 , 3 dei Fondi strutturali e i rispettivi collegamenti con il Fondo di coesione .\n",
      "Le priorità della Commissione sono presentate sulla base delle esperienze raccolte nella fase di realizzazione dei programmi nonché delle politiche comunitarie attuali connesse agli interventi strutturali .\n",
      "L ' obiettivo è far sì che tali priorità contribuiscano a un migliore utilizzo , a un utilizzo ottimale ed efficace degli interventi comunitari , come molti di voi hanno auspicato , anche facendo ricorso al momento opportuno , onorevole Bradbourn , alla riserva di prestazioni propriamente intesa a promuovere un utilizzo ottimale e efficace del denaro pubblico europeo .\n",
      "Quando parlo di utilizzo ottimale , intendo sia a livello nazionale che regionale , e dunque , onorevole Seppänen , parlando del livello nazionale , mi riferisco altresì al nesso con il Fondo di coesione .\n",
      "Questo in merito all ' obiettivo delle linee direttrici .\n",
      "In relazione al contenuto invece , come è noto agli onorevoli parlamentari , le linee direttrici si articolano intorno a tre priorità strategiche che la relatrice ha ricordato con grande chiarezza e anche con grande passione , come ho avuto modo di verificare nel suo intervento .\n",
      "La prima priorità consiste nel migliorare la competitività delle economie regionali per creare , in tutti i settori , ma in particolare nel privato , come ha affermato l ' onorevole Berend , il massimo di posti di lavoro seri , solidi e duraturi .\n",
      "Competitività delle economie regionali , di tutte le economie regionali , dunque , e in particolare del Galles , onorevole Evans , ma non solo del Galles .\n",
      "Aggiungo ancora , visto che molti di voi hanno ritenuto che si trattasse di un ' omissione , le economie regionali delle regioni europee sfavorite per la loro lontananza geografica , che si tratti di regioni periferiche , insulari oppure naturalmente di regioni ultraperiferiche , che sono poi le più lontane .\n",
      "Al riguardo , potrei forse rispondere all ' onorevole Ribeiro i Castro che mi ha interpellato , così come ho scritto ai presidenti delle regioni ultraperiferiche , che la Commissione ha chiesto qualche settimana di proroga per la pubblicazione della sua relazione ..\n",
      "Abbiamo ricevuto i memoranda dei governi delle regioni ultraperiferiche con molto ritardo , ma questo non vuole certo essere un alibi , semmai una spiegazione .\n",
      "Occorre svolgere un lavoro estremamente serio su tali memoranda .\n",
      "Ho partecipato personalmente a un incontro delle regioni ultraperiferiche il 23 novembre e il Collegio ha ritenuto che fosse necessaria qualche settimana supplementare per redigere una relazione all ' altezza dei problemi estremamente seri e gravi e delle aspettative di tali regioni ultraperiferiche e vi ringrazio per la comprensione .\n",
      "Ecco la prima priorità , cioè la competitività delle economie regionali .\n",
      "La seconda priorità , sulla quale molti di voi hanno insistito , in particolare l ' onorevole Puerta e altri ancora lungi da me il voler istituire un ordine gerarchico tra di esse è il rafforzamento della coesione sociale e dell ' occupazione , valorizzando soprattutto le risorse umane , meglio che in passato .\n",
      "Onorevoli parlamentari , nell ' Unione europea si constata un divario inferiore tra i paesi , il che dimostra l ' efficacia e l ' utilità del Fondo di coesione , ma al contempo si osserva - come scrive la relatrice - che in materia di disoccupazione lo scarto tra le 15 o 20 regioni più ricche e le 15 o 20 regioni più povere o più diseredate si fa sempre maggiore e tale situazione è e rimane ingiustificabile e intollerabile .\n",
      "A me personalmente - in considerazione della mia idea di costruzione europea e di politica dello sviluppo regionale in particolare - tale situazione risulta inaccettabile ed è mia intenzione fare tutto quanto è in mio potere , con il vostro sostegno , per mettere tutti i finanziamenti per i quali sono responsabile al servizio di una migliore coesione sociale , umana , territoriale proprio per sventare quella che un giorno di fronte a quest ' Aula ho definito un ' Europa a due velocità , un ' Europa dei bei quartieri e un ' Europa delle periferie povere .\n",
      "Il terzo obiettivo consiste nello sviluppo urbano e rurale , nel quadro di una politica equilibrata del territorio .\n",
      "In effetti le linee direttrici contemplano due principi orizzontali : in primo luogo lo sviluppo rurale e rivolgendomi alla onorevole relatrice ricordo che nello sviluppo rurale includo anche la questione dei trasporti sostenibili , che personalmente sostengo da molto tempo , e cioè fin dai tempi in cui sono stato Ministro dell ' ambiente del mio paese .\n",
      "Il secondo principio è costituito dalle pari opportunità , in particolare tra uomini e donne , nonché la strategia europea per l ' occupazione e il quadro dell ' Unione economica e monetaria .\n",
      "Infine , per rispondere alle preoccupazioni espresse dai diversi onorevoli parlamentari e in particolare dalla relatrice , le linee direttrici ricordano l ' importanza e la definizione di strategia integrate di sviluppo o di riconversione , che tra tutte le priorità attribuiscono la chance maggiore alle sinergie , alle misure adottate e alla realizzazione di un partenariato decentrato .\n",
      "E ' stata espressa preoccupazione per l ' apparente omissione di un riferimento a tale partenariato : in realtà esso è citato espressamente a pagina 5 delle linee direttrici , ma desidero ricordare - poiché sono stato sollecitato - che a mio avviso siffatto partenariato - sono stato attivo sufficientemente a lungo in una regione del mio paese per poterlo dire in tutta sincerità - è uno strumento , è la leva delle intelligenze locali vuoi nel settore pubblico , gli eletti , i settori socioeducativi o le associazioni , vuoi nel settore privato .\n",
      "Un partenariato decentrato , dunque , e per rispondere alla onorevole Angelilli ricordo evidentemente i patti territoriali che sono una delle forme di tale partenariato decentrato .\n",
      "Ecco i motivi per cui le linee direttrici sono presentate secondo priorità tematiche ; esse devono infatti essere prese in considerazione a titolo di ciascun obiettivo , a gradi diversi a seconda delle situazioni specifiche di ciascuno Stato membro e di ciascuna regione .\n",
      "Desidero ora rispondere ad alcune delle osservazioni degli onorevoli parlamentari , innanzi tutto sulla procedura .\n",
      "E ' un fatto che il Parlamento sia stato consultato tardivamente .\n",
      "Mi sia consentito ricordare che quando la Commissione ha adottato il progetto di linee direttrici nel febbraio 1999 , con una nuova procedura destinata a facilitare la presentazione di commenti al testo , il mio predecessore , la Commissario Monica Wulf-Mathies aveva tempestivamente presentato il testo al Parlamento .\n",
      "Vista l ' imminenza delle elezioni europee , in pratica il Parlamento ha potuto intraprendere l ' esame delle linee direttrici soltanto nel luglio 1999 , quando il testo era stato già adottato in via definitiva .\n",
      "Presentandomi a voi in qualità di Membro del nuovo Collegio , onorevoli parlamentari , mi preme rassicurarvi che nei negoziati sui programmi , appena iniziati per la gran parte degli Stati membri - il presidente Hatzidakis mi ha rivolto una domanda in tal senso - le vostre osservazioni saranno realmente prese in considerazione .\n",
      "Posso rassicurarvi inoltre che quando la Commissione adotterà le linee direttrici in vista della revisione intermedia , a norma di regolamento , terremo altrettanto conto del parere del Parlamento così come delineato nella relazione in esame .\n",
      "E ora sul merito , ovvero sul ruolo degli orientamenti , la relatrice ha sottolineato che è appunto in tale contesto che occorre indicare le linee direttrici su una serie di obiettivi europei , spesso assai precisi .\n",
      "Non voglio citarli tutti : la realizzazione di politiche intersettoriali , l ' aumento dell ' efficacia dell ' utilizzo dei fondi pubblici , il sostegno a favore dei diversi partner per realizzare insieme la pianificazione regionale o nazionale e via discorrendo .\n",
      "La Commissione prende atto , ma molti di tali orientamenti , o per meglio dire questioni , attengono piuttosto ad altri documenti , quali il Vademecum o il documento di lavoro metodologico .\n",
      "Per concludere vorrei soffermarmi su alcune richieste di cui la relatrice si è fatta portavoce .\n",
      "Per esempio l ' idea secondo cui le linee direttrici non sarebbero sufficientemente specifiche nelle raccomandazioni .\n",
      "Tale affermazione della relazione deve essere ricollocata nella prospettiva dei negoziati della scorsa primavera .\n",
      "La Commissione si è attenuta alla lettera dell ' articolo 10 del regolamento generale sui Fondi strutturali , il quale prevede che la vocazione di tali linee direttrici sia fornire agli Stati membri \" gli orientamenti generali indicativi sulle pertinenti politiche comunitarie concordate \" , e ho citato letteralmente il testo .\n",
      "Inoltre le linee direttrici non possono sostituire la programmazione né le valutazioni ex ante , che devono essere lo strumento proprio per specificare le priorità e l ' efficacia dei programmi .\n",
      "Onorevole Schroedter , lei ha evocato poi la sezione delle linee direttrici relativa allo sviluppo urbano e rurale e ha sottolineato che lo sviluppo urbano non è sufficientemente considerato .\n",
      "A me pare il contrario : confermo il grande interesse che la Commissione nutre e continuerà a nutrire per la valenza urbana della politica di coesione .\n",
      "Peraltro ho avuto modo di dichiararlo recentemente ai Ministri responsabili per la politica urbana in una riunione a Tampere .\n",
      "In materia di sviluppo rurale , sottolineato da molti onorevoli parlamentari intervenuti , in particolare dalla onorevole Redondo Jiménez , le linee direttrici rispondono appunto al duplice obiettivo evocato dalla relatrice : un settore agricolo forte , collegato a una maggiore competitività nelle zone rurali , ma anche la tutela dell ' ambiente e del patrimonio rurale dell ' Europa .\n",
      "Occorre tuttavia sottolineare che le linee direttrici in discussione riguardano esclusivamente i Fondi strutturali , i cui obiettivi 1 e 2 riconoscono come priorità appunto la diversificazione del mondo rurale .\n",
      "Parlando di equilibrio del mondo rurale , non dobbiamo dimenticare la nuova politica di sviluppo rurale , cofinanziata dal FEAOG , sezione garanzia , il cui ruolo è promuovere la riforma dell ' agricoltura europea e sostenere la multifunzionalità dell ' agricoltura .\n",
      "In questa fase mi limito a dire che auspico che essa sia integrata nella programmazione delle zone rurali dell ' obiettivo 2 , così come il FEAOG , sezione orientamento , è integrato nelle regioni dell ' obiettivo 1 .\n",
      "In ogni caso ho preso atto di quanto sia vigile la commissione per l ' agricoltura e lo sviluppo rurale su tali temi .\n",
      "Prima di concludere desidero dire all ' onorevole Savary che la discussione specifica sulle conseguenze delle tempeste che si sono abbattute nelle ultime settimane sulla Francia , l ' Austria e la Germania in particolare è prevista per domani , così come la discussione con la mia collega , la signora Commissario de Palacio , sulle lezioni da trarre dalla marea nera che ha colpito le coste francesi .\n",
      "Con il suo permesso , onorevole Savary , mi riservo di esprimere la mia posizione su questo tema , la quale coincide ampiamente con la raccomandazione che lei ha formulato su quanto si può fare per lottare contro la marea nera nel contesto dell' obiettivo 2 .\n",
      "Ricordo che domani la Commissione approverà la carta delle zone riconosciute come obiettivo 2 per la Francia , la Svezia , l ' Austria e il Lussemburgo , che ci fornirà uno strumento di lavoro , in particolare per gran parte dei dipartimenti colpiti dalle tempeste .\n",
      "Ecco il motivo per cui dopo domani mi recherò in visita nei due dipartimenti francesi gravemente danneggiati dal maltempo .\n",
      "Concludendo ringrazio il Presidente per la sua comprensione e la relatrice per la qualità del lavoro suo e della sua commissione parlamentare e desidero anche dire che , a prescindere da qualche differenza di valutazione sul ruolo delle linee direttrici , - ne abbiamo discusso e ho cercato di chiarire il mio punto di vista - sono molto lieto del sostegno espresso da questo Parlamento a favore dell ' elaborazione da parte della Commissione delle linee direttrici sottoposte agli Stati membri al fine di preparare i programmi nazionali .\n",
      "Ciò non può che confortare la concezione fondata sulle buone pratiche tratte dall ' esperienza dei programmi per il periodo 1994-1999 .\n",
      "Mi pare di buon auspicio per una valida cooperazione tra le nostre due Istituzioni , nel momento di avvio della programmazione per il 2000-2006 , una buona pratica di lavoro in comune , consolidata , onorevole Hatzidakis , dal rispetto del Codice di condotta che si impone alle nostre due Istituzioni e che a me sta particolarmente a cuore . La discussione è chiusa .\n",
      "La votazione avrà luogo domani , alle 12.00 .\n",
      " \n",
      "Situazione , sviluppo sociale ed economico delle regioni dell ' Unione L ' ordine del giorno reca la relazione ( A5-0107 / 1999 ) dell ' onorevole Berend , a nome della commissione per la politica regionale , i trasporti e il turismo , sulla sesta relazione periodica relativa alla situazione socioeconomica e allo sviluppo delle regioni dell ' Unione europea ( SEC ( 99 ) 0066 - C5-0120 / 99 - 1999 / 2123 ( COS ) ) . - ( DE ) Signor Presidente , signor Commissario Barnier , onorevoli colleghi , la sesta relazione periodica contiene una descrizione completa e dettagliata della situazione socioeconomica nelle regioni dell' Unione e delle loro tendenze di sviluppo .\n",
      "Essa rappresenta a mio parere una solida base per la formulazione delle priorità di politica strutturale a livello dell' Unione .\n",
      "Dalla relazione risulta che - in termini di prodotto interno lordo pro capite - si è registrato ed è tuttora in corso un processo di recupero da parte delle regioni più povere .\n",
      "Ciò è attribuibile in gran parte al contributo dei Fondi strutturali , anche se il divario fra le regioni più povere e quelle più ricche continua a essere considerevole .\n",
      "Il ricorso ai Fondi strutturali europei ha già consentito una maggiore omogeneità nelle condizioni di vita .\n",
      "La differenza nella media del PIL si è ridotta del 10 per cento nell' arco di dieci anni .\n",
      "L' impatto - ovviamente in senso positivo - è stato particolarmente sensibile nei quattro paesi che beneficiano dei contributi alla coesione e anche nei cinque nuovi Länder tedeschi .\n",
      "Purtroppo tale andamento su scala europea è associato soprattutto a un aumento della produttività e solo in misura trascurabile all' aumento dell' occupazione .\n",
      "Per questa ragione chiediamo alla Commissione e agli Stati membri in futuro di valutare con la dovuta attenzione anche l' efficacia delle misure in termini di ricaduta occupazionale .\n",
      "Una parte cospicua dei trasferimenti sono stati e vengono tuttora destinati a investimenti di razionalizzazione e modernizzazione finalizzati a migliorare la produttività del lavoro .\n",
      "In tal modo , tuttavia , vengono smorzati gli effetti occupazionali della politica strutturale .\n",
      "Questo non vuole essere un apprezzamento , ma una semplice constatazione .\n",
      "Dalla relazione emerge che i divari regionali sul versante del mercato del lavoro si sono persino approfonditi .\n",
      "Nelle 25 regioni più fortemente colpite la disoccupazione raggiunge attualmente il 24 percento .\n",
      "Dieci anni fa era del 4 percento inferiore , pari cioè al 20 percento .\n",
      "Nelle 25 regioni meno colpite si registra oggi un tasso medio di disoccupazione del 3,6 percento con un aumento pari soltanto all ' 1,1 percento rispetto a dieci anni fa , quando si attestava al 2,5 percento .\n",
      "La relazione indica che il 50 percento della disoccupazione è di tipo strutturale .\n",
      "Pertanto - e questa è una conclusione alla quale si perviene proprio leggendo il documento - è necessario porre al centro della politica strutturale la promozione della competitività del settore manifatturiero e il potenziamento delle infrastrutture economiche .\n",
      "In questo caso l' ordine di successione corrisponde a un ordine di priorità .\n",
      "A tale proposito va senz' altro fatta rilevare la necessità di misure di aggiornamento e riqualificazione professionale .\n",
      "Inoltre occorre attribuire maggiore attenzione al rafforzamento dell' imprenditorialità nelle piccole e medie imprese , potenziando i servizi a favore delle PMI .\n",
      "Un' ulteriore conclusione che si può trarre dalla relazione è che in vista di un efficiente utilizzo delle risorse occorre conciliare le misure di sostegno con i vari programmi di assistenza a favore del settore privato e delle imprese in fase di avviamento .\n",
      "Si tratta di un aspetto a mio avviso estremamente importante .\n",
      "Nella presente relazione si richiama altresì l' attenzione della Commissione sulla necessità di migliorare le basi giuridiche per la cooperazione fra le regioni degli Stati membri e i paesi candidati all' adesione , sottolineando in particolare l' esigenza di consolidamento di bilancio quale presupposto per il successo dell' Unione economica e monetaria e per l' ampliamento a est .\n",
      "Sollecitiamo infine gli Stati membri che ancora non hanno presentato un elenco completo delle regioni da finanziare a farlo quanto prima e chiediamo ovviamente alla Commissione di esaminare senza indugio e alla luce dei risultati della sesta relazione periodica i programmi operativi delle regioni per il nuovo periodo di finanziamento nonché a fare tutto il possibile per consentire un inizio puntuale di detto periodo anche a livello locale .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , la sesta relazione periodica sulla situazione e lo sviluppo sociale e economico delle regioni dell ' Unione europea segna un passaggio importante nell ' analisi dei dati regionali e mette in rilievo i progressi realizzati in tale campo dopo la pubblicazione della quinta relazione periodica .\n",
      "Tuttavia , ritengo che parlare di una vera convergenza dello sviluppo regionale medio in Europa offra un ' immagine un po ' monca della realtà , e purtroppo è proprio questo il messaggio trasmesso dalla stampa e proclamato in taluni discorsi .\n",
      "La relazione della Commissione relativizza ampiamente tale constatazione , soprattutto quando illustra la situazione socioeconomica di talune regioni dell ' Unione che mi stanno particolarmente a cuore : mi riferisco ai dipartimenti francesi d ' oltremare e più in generale alle regioni ultraperiferiche .\n",
      "Mi rallegro dunque che la commissione per la politica regionale , i trasporti e il turismo abbia approvato un mio emendamento che invita la Commissione a riservare un capitolo speciale della prossima relazione al tema della coesione nelle regioni periferiche e , più specificamente , all ' analisi dell ' impatto delle misure che saranno approvate prossimamente in conformità al nuovo articolo 299 , paragrafo 2 , del Trattato di Amsterdam .\n",
      "Concludendo , mi pare che la sesta relazione periodica offra argomentazioni interessanti nell ' ottica di un reale progetto di sviluppo sostenibile ed equilibrato del territorio europeo , segnatamente sottolineando l ' importanza del legame tra centro e periferia dell ' Europa .\n",
      "Anche se la Commissione esita ancora a esprimersi in termini troppo espliciti , la relazione periodica dimostra quanto sia urgente promuovere uno sviluppo policentrico dello spazio comunitario tramite le politiche strutturali dell ' Unione e nel contesto dell ' iniziativa lanciata dal sistema dei conti nazionali e regionali ( SEC ) .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , il gruppo del Partito del socialismo europeo di questo Parlamento è d ' accordo con la relazione appena presentata dall ' onorevole Berend e si congratula con l ' autore , sia per la qualità delle conclusioni che per la sua flessibilità , che ha permesso di accogliere in sede di commissione emendamenti provenienti dai vari gruppi .\n",
      "E ' bene ricordare che attualmente la competitività globale dell ' Unione europea è pari all ' 81percento di quella degli Stati Uniti d ' America e che questo dato migliorerà solo se migliora quello delle nostre unità competitive , ovvero le regioni , e ciò in un momento in cui l ' evoluzione tecnologica , la globalizzazione economica e i nostri problemi , l ' ampliamento e la moneta unica , richiedono alle regioni , ma anche alle imprese e agli individui , un maggior sforzo competitivo .\n",
      "La sesta relazione della Commissione europea presenta conclusioni molto preziose .\n",
      "Ne riassumo due , già ricordate dal relatore , una positiva e l ' altra negativa .\n",
      "La prima è che sono stati conseguiti progressi rilevanti nella coesione territoriale e sociale in tutto il territorio dell ' Unione e che i Fondi comunitari sono stati un fattore importante , anche se non decisivo , nella diminuzione delle disuguaglianze regionali .\n",
      "Quella negativa è che questo grande sforzo è stato più efficace nell ' avvicinare il PIL e la produttività delle regioni europee piuttosto che i livelli di occupazione .\n",
      "Quindi è necessario vincolare maggiormente il finanziamento strutturale alla creazione di posti di lavoro .\n",
      "E ' il primo ordine , signor Commissario , per il prossimo periodo .\n",
      "Pertanto , signor Presidente , invito gli illustri colleghi ad approvare la relazione e chiedo alla Commissione , come hanno fatto altri colleghi , di tenere ben presenti le conclusioni del suo sesto rapporto periodico per la programmazione del periodo 2000-2006 .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , desidererei prima di tutto ringraziare il relatore per l' eccellente lavoro svolto e per aver tenuto in considerazione gli emendamenti presentati durante il dibattito in commissione .\n",
      "La sesta relazione periodica fornisce la base necessaria per valutare il raggiungimento degli obiettivi della politica regionale dell' Unione europea .\n",
      "La relazione indica che , nonostante le misure adottate , la crescita continua a essere disuguale .\n",
      "Le regioni dell' Europa centrale sono teatro di una crescita estremamente rapida .\n",
      "I centri più sviluppati crescono a un ritmo nettamente superiore rispetto alla media europea , mentre alcune regioni dell' Europa meridionale e settentrionale continuano a segnare il passo .\n",
      "Adesso sarebbe importante analizzare a fondo le cause di questo fenomeno e i motivi per cui la politica regionale non sia in grado di produrre ovunque i risultati sperati .\n",
      "E ' colpa della burocrazia o del fatto che le differenze regionali , le lunghe distanze , il clima troppo caldo o troppo freddo , la densità di popolazione e le condizioni di vita non sono state tenute sufficientemente in considerazione ?\n",
      "Come può l' Unione affrontare la sfida della globalizzazione , assicurando che anche le regioni meno sviluppate possano rimanere al passo con questo tipo di evoluzione ?\n",
      "Sarebbe importante analizzare quali impatti avrà l' ampliamento dell' Unione europea e lo sviluppo delle regioni più periferiche dell' UE .\n",
      "Gli Stati membri devono inoltre ricordare quali sono le loro responsabilità .\n",
      "Alcuni di loro hanno violato il principio di sviluppo e ridotto i fondi regionali , nonostante l' aumento dei finanziamenti provenienti dall' Unione europea .\n",
      "Ciò ha inciso negativamente sui risultati della politica regionale .\n",
      "In futuro sarà necessario identificare indicatori che ci consentano di sviluppare tempestivamente gli interventi necessari nelle regioni più bisognose .\n",
      "Per esempio , il crescente flusso migratorio non è stato tenuto sufficientemente in considerazione .\n",
      "Anche in questo caso sarebbe necessario sottolineare l' importanza del contributo delle piccole e medie imprese come motore per promuovere l' occupazione e lo sviluppo locale .\n",
      "Un altro punto estremamente importante è quello legato alle tecnologie d' avanguardia che dovrebbero essere messe a disposizione anche delle imprese operanti nelle regioni meno sviluppate .\n",
      "Il nostro gruppo appoggia l' approvazione di questa relazione .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , finora la politica regionale della Comunità europea non è riuscita a tenere conto in modo tangibile le differenze di reddito per abitante .\n",
      "La situazione è grave al punto che oggi anche nell ' Unione europea è evidente il nesso fra disoccupazione e povertà , come si desume dal fatto molto preoccupante che la disoccupazione raggiunge in media il 23,7 percento nelle regioni più colpite da questo problema , che coincidono con le zone povere , mentre nelle 25 regioni che corrispondono alle zone ricche la disoccupazione è di appena il 4 percento .\n",
      "A fronte di questa situazione , nella relazione sottoposta all ' approvazione del Parlamento occorre indicare chiaramente la necessità di misure destinate inequivocabilmente a combattere la povertà relativa e la disoccupazione .\n",
      "Misure volte a tal fine come l ' applicazione appropriata dei Fondi strutturali , spesso spesi male , con politiche statali centralizzate , ammodernamento delle telecomunicazioni e delle comunicazioni , inserendo specialmente le regioni meno sviluppate nelle reti ferroviarie transeuropee in vista del 2007 , rispetto e sviluppo delle risorse e delle capacità agricole e della pesca di quei paesi , spesso colpiti dalle politiche stesse di un ' Unione europea indifferente e promozione di politiche attive volte alla creazione di posti di lavoro , preferibilmente per le donne e i giovani .\n",
      "Unicamente applicando con determinazione misure di questo tipo sarà possibile ovviare alla sperequazione sociale e territoriale che non è esito storico di inevitabili pecche , bensì di emarginazione e di politiche economiche dalle ricadute negative .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , la presente relazione del collega , onorevole Berend , si attiene esattamente alla strategia adottata dalla Commissione europea , dando l' assoluta priorità all' aspetto dell' aumento della competitività .\n",
      "Vengono invece citati solo marginalmente gli obiettivi di più ampia portata dei Fondi strutturali , quali l' incremento dell' occupazione , il miglioramento delle pari opportunità , la maggiore sostenibilità dell' occupazione e dello sviluppo .\n",
      "Ritengo che una tale impostazione sia ingiustificata e chiedo che nella sesta relazione periodica si tengano in maggiore considerazione i punti summenzionati .\n",
      "Ciò non significa che non veda la necessità di rafforzare la competitività , tanto più che io stesso sono un imprenditore che opera in una regione dell' obiettivo 1 , ossia nel Brandeburgo , in Germania , e conosco perfettamente le preoccupazioni e i bisogni delle piccole e medie imprese .\n",
      "Nelle regioni comprese nell' obiettivo 1 è assolutamente necessario introdurre parallelamente misure a termine volte a promuovere la creazione di posti di lavoro , programmi speciali a favore dell' imprenditorialità giovanile e iniziative di sostegno all' avvio di attività in proprio .\n",
      "Tali settori vengono sovvenzionati attraverso interventi appropriati previsti nel quadro dei Fondi strutturali dell' Unione europea .\n",
      "Il solo sostegno alla competitività delle imprese non può consentire di raggiungere l' auspicata coesione fra sviluppo economico e sviluppo sociale , visto che nelle regioni comprese nell' obiettivo 1 mancano le basi per una ripresa economica autonoma .\n",
      "Lo sviluppo economico , da solo , non contribuisce a ridurre la disoccupazione , come dimostra il fatto che occorre almeno il 3percento di aumento del prodotto nazionale lordo per creare ulteriori posti di lavoro .\n",
      "Concentrandosi esclusivamente sulla politica economica orientata alla domanda e all' offerta non è possibile raggiungere i risultati auspicati .\n",
      "E anche nel caso lo si faccia , si devono effettuare cospicui investimenti di potenziamento e meno investimenti di razionalizzazione .\n",
      "Ciò va assolutamente associato a una politica economica orientata alla domanda per poter avere la possibilità di migliorare la situazione in queste regioni .\n",
      "Le situazioni nelle varie regioni sono alquanto diverse e ciò significa che occorre attuare una serie di misure di accompagnamento per poter intervenire in qualche modo .\n",
      "Sono necessari , per esempio , interventi nei settori della formazione professionale , della formazione permanente , del reinserimento dei lavoratori espulsi dal processo produttivo , dell' organizzazione flessibile dell' orario di lavoro e dei tipi di orario di lavoro , per poter conciliare molto meglio gli aspetti personali e sociali e poter favorire nuovamente l' accesso al mercato del lavoro delle donne .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , i miei complimenti al relatore per la sua approfondita relazione .\n",
      "Obiettivo principale dei Fondi strutturali è rafforzare la coesione sociale ed economica fra le regioni dell' Unione europea .\n",
      "Stimolando gli investimenti più disparati , l' Unione tenta di realizzare l' aumento del PIL per abitante e di far crescere l' occupazione .\n",
      "Dalla sesta relazione periodica sulle regioni si può desumere , con una certa cautela , che i suddetti incentivi non sempre sortiscono l' effetto sperato .\n",
      "Gli sforzi volti all' aumento del PIL per abitante nelle regioni dell' obiettivo 1 non sempre generano tale aumento .\n",
      "Non si può certo dire che sia un risultato soddisfacente , dato che il periodo di riferimento , quantomeno negli ultimi anni , è stato caratterizzato da una ripresa economica .\n",
      "Come sottolinea il relatore , nemmeno le misure strutturali volte al potenziamento dell' occupazione hanno dato effetti degni di nota .\n",
      "Per tale motivo una certa riluttanza nei confronti dell' efficacia degli aiuti comunitari è più che giustificata .\n",
      "Seri dubbi sorgono altresì dalla constatazione che a volte le differenze fra le regioni all' interno degli Stati membri addirittura aumentano .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , a questo punto mi sembra logico e necessario concentrare tutta l' attenzione sulle autorità sia nazionali che regionali , sicuramente se parliamo di promozione dell' occupazione , dato che in ultima analisi sono loro che conoscono meglio la situazione delle regioni che rientrano nelle loro competenze .\n",
      "Il rendimento si può aumentare dando alle autorità nazionali o regionali la possibilità di sviluppare piani su misura per le regioni interessate , e concedendo , se del caso , sostegno finanziario .\n",
      "Del resto il nostro obiettivo è proprio aumentare il rendimento degli sforzi compiuti .\n",
      "Pertanto concordo con piacere con l' idea che la Commissione lasci agli Stati membri e alle regioni l' elaborazione pratica e l' attuazione delle misure .\n",
      "Sempre in questo contesto , potrebbe essere sensato dare maggiori competenze agli Stati membri anche in materia di sostegno finanziario alle regioni .\n",
      "Spostando l' accento dei criteri dalle regioni agli Stati membri possiamo evitare in futuro svariati problemi .\n",
      "Infine desidero attirare l' attenzione sulla posizione dei paesi dell' Europa centrale e orientale .\n",
      "La relazione illustra che in generale tali paesi sono in grave ritardo rispetto agli Stati membri dell' Unione , soprattutto per quanto attiene al PIL per abitante .\n",
      "In vista della prossima adesione di un gran numero di tali paesi , è urgente rivedere l' attuale politica strutturale .\n",
      "Mi associo dunque all' appello lanciato da altri colleghi , e invito la Commissione a presentare con celerità proposte di riforma .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , onorevoli colleghi , signor Commissario , da un esame approfondito della relazione in discussione si giunge indubbiamente alla conclusione che gli obiettivi prefissati di politica strutturale sono stati raggiunti solo in parte .\n",
      "Infatti le disparità fra le regioni sono aumentate , più che essersi ridotte , e fra gli Stati membri si registra una certa omogeneità da questo punto di vista .\n",
      "Anche il numero dei disoccupati nelle regioni maggiormente colpite è calato solo in misura irrisoria e in alcuni casi è persino aumentato .\n",
      "Mi chiedo dunque da che cosa dipenda l' inefficienza nell' utilizzo delle risorse dei Fondi strutturali .\n",
      "Anche il sommarsi di finanziamenti provenienti dal Fondo di coesione e dai Fondi strutturali non ha consentito di ottenere i risultati sperati in tutte le regioni e in tutti i paesi .\n",
      "Poiché l' obiettivo dichiarato di tutti i politici europei è ridurre la disoccupazione , occorre chiedersi criticamente se la politica perseguita attualmente sia quella giusta o se non sia più opportuno rafforzare la competitività delle regioni attraverso misure adeguate , quali la promozione del settore della ricerca e sviluppo , il miglioramento delle infrastrutture e l' innalzamento del livello di formazione .\n",
      "I presupposti per assicurare condizioni favorevoli allo sviluppo economico sono serie riforme strutturali e una politica fiscale che incentivi la concorrenza .\n",
      "Se vogliamo evitare che ci venga rimproverato di perseguire una politica strutturale dai costi elevati e che non riesce ad avere effetti durevoli sulla situazione occupazionale , occorre rivedere le misure finora adottate .\n",
      "La politica strutturale dell' Unione avrà successo soltanto a condizione che si riesca a creare un numero sufficiente di posti di lavoro e che la quota di disoccupati si riduca in misura significativa .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , ringrazio il relatore per l' importante lavoro svolto ; ritengo infatti che proprio attraverso il miglioramento della situazione socioeconomica i cittadini europei possano valutare i risultati del nostro operato .\n",
      "Questo tema , che influisce sulla loro vita quotidiana , ha un' importanza chiave ai fini della credibilità dell' Unione europea .\n",
      "Si deve ammettere che l' Unione europea ha già sostenuto - oserei dire mirabilmente - lo sviluppo dei paesi più poveri .\n",
      "Penso , per esempio , a com' erano il Portogallo e la Grecia quando ho gareggiato lì per la prima volta venticinque anni fa .\n",
      "In francese si direbbe \" coup de chapeau \" , cioè tanto di cappello all' UE .\n",
      "Se è vero che l' Unione europea merita tutto il nostro apprezzamento in seno a una stessa nazione , le differenze tra le regioni più povere e quelle più ricche rimangono abissali .\n",
      "Quali sono le conseguenze ?\n",
      "La gente reagisce andando a guadagnarsi il pane altrove .\n",
      "In questo modo , siamo costretti a costruire ancora una volta nel medesimo Stato , scuole , ospedali e tutte le infrastrutture per le stesse persone .\n",
      "Ciò è estremamente costoso e causa problemi sociali molto gravi .\n",
      "Molti sarebbero disposti a vivere nelle regioni d' origine , se si desse loro la possibilità di farlo e se ci fosse il lavoro .\n",
      "Il nostro compito è quello di offrire loro tale possibilità .\n",
      "Questo è l' impegno morale non solo dell' Unione europea ma di tutti noi .\n",
      "La soluzione , ritengo , sia quella di incentivare maggiormente l' imprenditorialità .\n",
      "Per imprenditorialità non intendo solo la proprietà di un' azienda , ma anche un modo di essere , quel desiderio di avanzare nella vita a prescindere dal fatto che a nutrirlo sia un lavoratore subordinato , un imprenditore o un dipendente pubblico .\n",
      "Come dovrebbe essere una società equa ?\n",
      "Dovrebbe essere in grado di offrire la possibilità di avanzare anche a coloro i quali provengono da condizioni più umili , in modo da permettere loro di offrire ai loro figli una vita migliore .\n",
      "In questo modo anche le regioni possono svilupparsi positivamente , poiché le persone cercano di avanzare e di lavorare se hanno la possibilità di farlo .\n",
      "Infine desidererei aggiungere che , forse , dovremmo imparare un po ' di più dall' America , dove l ' operosità non è mai passata di moda e dove il successo è indice di capacità e non motivo di invidia , come spesso accade da noi , in Europa .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , signor Commissario , onorevoli colleghi , avendo a disposizione solo una manciata di secondi andrò dritto all ' essenziale .\n",
      "Innanzi tutto una constatazione : i frutti della crescita non sono equamente distribuiti all ' interno dell ' Unione , esempio ne siano le regioni ultraperiferiche , tuttora duramente colpite da una disoccupazione che raggiunge livelli drammatici .\n",
      "Nell ' isola della Riunione , per esempio , il tasso di disoccupazione è del 37 percento .\n",
      "Non si tratta , però , di una situazione congiunturale , bensì strutturale : sono la nostra distanza geografica , la nostra insularità , in una parola , la personalità che ci è propria a determinare tale situazione .\n",
      "Per farvi fronte l ' articolo 299 , paragrafo 2 del Trattato di Amsterdam ha previsto il principio di un trattamento specifico e derogatorio , che occorre ora tradurre in atti concreti .\n",
      "Il documento della Commissione , annunciato per dicembre 1999 , è stato dapprima rinviato a gennaio , poi a febbraio e le prime riflessioni non mi inducono certo all ' ottimismo .\n",
      "Lancio quindi un appello solenne al Consiglio e alla Commissione : in materia di fiscalità , aiuti di Stato , Fondi strutturali , difesa delle produzioni tradizionali è urgente delineare misure concrete , audaci e ambiziose , senza le quali la convergenza e la coesione resteranno , purtroppo per noi , solo lettera morta , con il rischio che la politica strutturale nelle nostre regioni , nonostante i finanziamenti cospicui , si traduca in un fiasco .\n",
      "Signor Presidente , come hanno fatto tutti gli oratori vorrei a mia volta ringraziare l ' onorevole Berend e congratularmi con lui per la qualità del lavoro svolto .\n",
      "Come per la relazione precedente , l ' analisi estremamente competente e precisa , le raccomandazioni suggerite e le osservazioni degli onorevoli parlamentari saranno utili alla Commissione e in particolare al Commissario responsabile per la politica regionale , ai fini della programmazione degli stanziamenti per il 2000-2006 .\n",
      "Mi sia consentita qualche osservazione , prima di tutto sul giudizio formulato dal relatore sulla sesta relazione periodica .\n",
      "Il relatore ne sottolinea la qualità e scrive altresì , se non vado errato , che la sesta relazione rappresenta un deciso miglioramento rispetto alle relazioni precedenti .\n",
      "A nome di tutti i funzionari della Commissione e del mio predecessore , la Commissario Wulf-Mathies , mi preme dire che siamo molto sensibili a questo apprezzamento espresso dall ' Aula e dal relatore stesso .\n",
      "E ' un fatto , onorevole Berend , che la Commissione teneva particolarmente a che la sesta relazione periodica consentisse di rilevare un impegno , un salto di qualità nell ' analisi che propone .\n",
      "Mi riferisco in particolare al contenuto del capitolo 2.1 della relazione , dove la Commissione esamina in modo più approfondito le definizioni economiche di competitività regionale e cerca di analizzare in che misura tale competitività può essere promossa , migliorata , influenzata dai fattori che alcuni onorevoli parlamentari , dall ' onorevole Markov poc ' anzi , alla onorevole Raschhofer hanno sottolineato con tanto fervore .\n",
      "Mi riferisco alla ricerca e allo sviluppo tecnologico , alla dotazione e alla qualità delle infrastrutture , al potenziale delle risorse umane , alle piccole e medie imprese , agli investimenti stranieri diretti .\n",
      "Questo per quanto attiene alla qualità .\n",
      "Onorevole Berend , non intendo soffermarmi troppo a lungo sui punti generali sui quali il Parlamento ha già indicato il proprio accordo , mi limito a citarli telegraficamente : in primo luogo l ' utilità delle conclusioni della relazione ai fini della fissazione delle priorità per la nuova politica regionale , in particolare nel contesto del negoziato sui documenti di programmazione con gli Stati membri .\n",
      "Secondo , il partenariato , sui cui hanno insistito molti onorevoli parlamentari , il ruolo delle autorità locali e regionali , del settore privato , delle parti sociali , del settore associativo e degli enti locali promotori .\n",
      "Sul tema del partenariato sarò particolarmente vigile rispetto alla corretta applicazione delle disposizioni del regolamento generale sui Fondi strutturali .\n",
      "Terzo punto , la necessità di promuovere la valenza occupazionale della crescita , anche se so bene , l ' onorevole Van Dam lo ha appena ricordato , che la responsabilità primaria spetta agli Stati membri e che quando si parla della responsabilità degli Stati membri oppure dell ' utilità e dell ' efficacia di questa politica regionale , occorre ovviamente tenere conto del periodo in cui ci troviamo .\n",
      "L ' onorevole Fruteau ha appena dichiarato che i frutti della crescita non sono equamente ripartiti .\n",
      "Ma per cominciare , onorevole parlamentare , la crescita deve esserci e non ci si deve trovare globalmente in una fase di stagnazione o di recessione , come è avvenuto in passato .\n",
      "Mi ribatterete che la crescita o la penuria non valgono per tutti e sono pienamente d ' accordo con tali analisi .\n",
      "Nei periodi di crescita occorre ripartirla in modo ottimale , ma ciò che è ancora più difficile e che tocca con gravità ancora maggiore le regioni sfavorite a causa della loro distanza , cioè le regioni ultraperiferiche o insulari , è l ' assenza di crescita che ha caratterizzato globalmente i due ultimi decenni .\n",
      "Quarto punto , su cui ha insistito or ora la onorevole Hedkvist Petersen : la promozione di una politica di pari opportunità per le donne e per i giovani .\n",
      "Quinto aspetto , l ' importanza e il ruolo delle piccole e medie imprese , l ' onorevole Vatanen lo ha appena sottolineato con grande fervore .\n",
      "Infine , gli effetti positivi sulle amministrazioni nazionali del sistema di gestione dei Fondi strutturali , la motivazione dei funzionari nella gestione di tali Fondi , anche se un po ' complicata , e l ' importanza di migliorare nuovamente le procedure di valutazione , di seguito e di controllo della Commissione .\n",
      "Al riguardo , informo il Parlamento europeo che è mia intenzione organizzare verso la metà del 2000 un seminario con le autorità nazionali e regionali sul tema della valutazione delle procedure di scambio delle buone pratiche nella gestione dei Fondi strutturali .\n",
      "Desidero soffermarmi su alcuni punti specifici .\n",
      "Onorevole Berend , lei ha auspicato che la divisione in zone sia applicata quanto prima .\n",
      "Siamo alla fine di questo processo di mappatura : domani la Commissione adotterà una decisione relativamente a quattro nuovi paesi , e molto presto , spero , sarà la volta dell ' Italia .\n",
      "Su tale punto può dunque ritenersi soddisfatto poiché tutti i paesi interessati dall ' obiettivo 2 avranno l ' elenco delle proprie zone .\n",
      "In merito all ' economia sommersa , cui si fa cenno nella sua relazione , so perfettamente che l ' analisi e la produzione di statistiche in materia si basa sull ' affidabilità dei dati e come ha ricordato l ' onorevole Cocilovo , l ' affidabilità dei dati è un problema .\n",
      "In una certa misura tali dati sono ripresi nelle statistiche sul PIL , nelle inchieste sulla forza lavoro e mi preme comunque mettere in rilievo l ' impegno presente e futuro di Eurostat per migliorare la qualità delle statistiche .\n",
      "Onorevole Berend , lei ha evocato , al pari dell ' onorevole Aparicio Sánchez , la mancata riforma del settore della pesca .\n",
      "Su tale punto che mi interessa personalmente , ricordo che le dimensioni limitate del settore - il che non significa affatto che esso sia trascurabile - e la sua concentrazione in un ristretto numero di regioni non facilita l ' analisi a livello regionale .\n",
      "L ' analisi per settore fa capo piuttosto alla pratica e alla competenza della Direzione generale pesca guidata dal mio collega Fischler .\n",
      "Tuttavia tengo ad assicurarvi che la Commissione si sforzerà di includere tale analisi nella seconda relazione sulla coesione , che senza dubbio si presterà meglio a tali preoccupazioni .\n",
      "Molti di voi hanno citato punti che andrebbero inseriti nella seconda relazione sulla coesione e lo stesso relatore si è soffermato su alcuni di essi .\n",
      "Mi preme rassicurarvi che la fusione delle relazioni periodiche con la relazione sulla coesione non dovrebbe comportare una perdita di informazioni né una perdita di interesse per il contenuto della relazione sulla coesione che , per me , onorevole Berend , è uno strumento estremamente importante , non soltanto per rendere conto di quanto si fa in modo trasparente e rigoroso , ma anche per esaminare e valutare i futuri orientamenti , nonché per stimolare un dibattito pubblico con i cittadini e anche con i rappresentanti eletti , quali voi siete , sulla politica regionale e su quella che un giorno potrebbe essere una politica europea di gestione del territorio .\n",
      "Comunque sia ho preso atto dell ' auspicio da voi formulato di includere nella relazione i seguenti punti : la definizione , la raccolta e l ' analisi di indicatori rappresentativi per la regione e per tutti i paesi dell ' Europa centrale e orientale ; un capitolo sulle isole e sulle regioni ultraperiferiche che molti di voi hanno richiamato , in particolare la onorevole Sudre e l ' onorevole Fruteau ; le analisi relative alla competitività delle regioni dei paesi dell ' Europa centrale e orientale - la grande sfida per noi , per voi e per la Commissione nei prossimi anni - e infine gli aspetti transfrontalieri .\n",
      "Su tali punti mi sforzerò di attenermi alle vostre raccomandazioni .\n",
      "Infine vorrei formulare alcune conclusioni politiche che vi sono ben note , ma delle quali vorrei richiamare gli elementi principali .\n",
      "Onorevoli parlamentari , abbiamo realizzato progressi significativi sulla strada della convergenza reale per i quattro Stati membri della coesione ma anche , onorevole Pohjamo , e lo dico in tutta franchezza , per le regioni dell ' obiettivo 2 che hanno recuperato i ritardi nello sviluppo soprattutto per le infrastrutture .\n",
      "Questa è la prima osservazione politica .\n",
      "Secondo punto politico : i Fondi strutturali hanno apportato e continueranno ad apportare un contributo significativo al processo di ravvicinamento .\n",
      "Tutti i modelli macroeconomici sui quali lavoriamo indicano , per lo scorso decennio , che più di un terzo della convergenza ottenuta nelle regioni in ritardo di sviluppo non avrebbe avuto luogo senza i Fondi strutturali .\n",
      "Detto questo ho preso nota che , per quanto riguarda le regioni ultraperiferiche , la onorevole Sudre , l ' onorevole Fruteau oppure ancora l ' onorevole Nogueira Román ritengono che rimanga ancora molto da fare - e questo è il mio terzo punto - sul piano di un maggior apporto in termini occupazionali della ripresa , della lotta contro l ' esclusione sociale , particolarmente grave e intollerabile in molte nostre regioni , dell ' integrazione delle donne e dei giovani sul mercato del lavoro .\n",
      "Quarto aspetto politico : l ' ampliamento dell ' Unione , il grande progetto politico e umanista degli anni futuri per le nostre istituzioni , la più grande sfida alla politica di coesione in Europa , un punto sul quale ha insistito l ' onorevole Van Dam .\n",
      "Mi preme affermare che grazie a Berlino e agli altri strumenti finanziari disponibili si profila fin d ' ora una politica di coesione per i primi paesi che aderiranno .\n",
      "Mi riferisco in particolare allo strumento strutturale di preadesione ( SSPA ) della cui attuazione sarò responsabile nelle prossime settimane .\n",
      "Onorevoli parlamentari , come vedete , abbiamo appena lanciato la nuova programmazione che già ci troviamo insieme a formulare una riflessione sull ' impatto dell ' ampliamento dell ' Unione sulla nostra politica strutturale .\n",
      "La sesta relazione periodica sulla quale , onorevole Berend , lei ha formulato un giudizio ampiamente positivo , costituisce per noi e per me una buona base di riflessione .\n",
      "La ringrazio sinceramente per il suo contributo alla riflessione sui futuri orientamenti e anche per la buona applicazione delle linee direttrici per il periodo 2000-2006 .\n",

      "Zwar können wir jetzt zwei finnische und einen portugiesischen , nach wie vor aber keinen niederländischen Sender empfangen .\n",
      "Ich hatte Sie aber um ein niederländisches Programm gebeten , denn auch wir Niederländer möchten die Nachrichten verfolgen , wenn wir jeden Monat hierher in die Verbannung geschickt werden .\n",
      "Deshalb möchte ich Sie nochmals ersuchen , dafür Sorge zu tragen , daß auch ein niederländischer Sender eingespeist wird .\n",
      "Frau Plooij-van Gorsel , ich kann Ihnen mitteilen , daß dieser Punkt am Mittwoch auf der Tagesordnung der Quästoren steht .\n",

      "Frau Präsidentin , können Sie mir sagen , warum sich dieses Parlament nicht an die Arbeitsschutzregelungen hält , die es selbst verabschiedet hat ?\n",
      "Weshalb wurde die Luftqualität in diesem Gebäude seit unserer Wahl nicht ein einziges Mal überprüft ?\n",
      "Weshalb ist der Arbeitsschutzausschuß seit 1998 nicht ein einziges Mal zusammengetreten ?\n",
      "Warum hat weder im Brüsseler noch im Straßburger Parlamentsgebäude eine Brandschutzübung stattgefunden ?\n",
      "Warum finden keine Brandschutzbelehrungen statt ?\n",

      "Es ist eine Schande , daß wir Regeln verabschieden , an die wir uns dann selbst nicht halten .\n",
      "Frau Lynne , Sie haben völlig recht , und ich werde prüfen , ob all dies wirklich so ist .\n",
      "Ich werde die Frage auch den Quästoren unterbreiten .\n",

      "Frau Díez González und ich hatten einige Anfragen zu bestimmten , in einer spanischen Zeitung wiedergegebenen Stellungnahmen der Vizepräsidentin , Frau de Palacio , gestellt .\n",
      "Die zuständigen Dienste haben sie nicht in die Tagesordnung aufgenommen , da sie der Meinung waren , sie seien schon in einer vorangegangenen Sitzung beantwortet worden .\n",
      "Ich bitte , diese Entscheidung zu überdenken , weil das nicht der Fall ist .\n",
      "Die früher beantworteten Anfragen bezogen sich auf das Auftreten von Frau de Palacio in einer bestimmten Angelegenheit , nicht auf die am 18. November des vergangenen Jahres in der Tageszeitung ABC erschienenen Erklärungen .\n",
      "Lieber Kollege , wir werden das prüfen .\n",
      "Ich muß Ihnen aber sagen , daß ich die Lage im Moment für etwas verworren halte .\n",
      "Wir werden das aber sehr genau prüfen , damit alles seine Richtigkeit hat .\n",
      "Frau Präsidentin , ich wüßte gern , ob das Parlament in dieser Woche ein deutliches Signal unserer Unzufriedenheit bezüglich der heutigen Entscheidung , mit der eine Verlängerung des Waffenembargos gegen Indonesien abgelehnt wird , aussenden wird , zumal sich die große Mehrheit in diesem Parlament in der Vergangenheit für das Waffenembargo gegen Indonesien ausgesprochen hat .\n",
      "Die heutige Entscheidung gegen eine Verlängerung des Embargos birgt angesichts der dortigen Lage eine sehr große Gefahr .\n",
      "Das Parlament sollte , da dies dem Wunsch der großen Mehrheit entspricht , eine entsprechende Botschaft senden .\n",
      "Die Ablehnung einer Verlängerung des Embargos seitens der EU-Mitgliedstaaten ist unverantwortlich .\n",
      "Wie bereits festgestellt wurde , ist die Lage in Indonesien äußerst instabil .\n",
      "Es besteht sogar die Gefahr eines Militärputsches .\n",
      "Wir wissen nicht , was passiert .\n",
      "Weshalb also sollten Waffenhersteller in der EU auf Kosten unschuldiger Menschen Profite einstreichen ?\n",
      "Dieser Punkt ist bisher nicht für die Dringlichkeitsdebatte am Donnerstag vorgesehen .\n",

      "Arbeitsplan Nach der Tagesordnung folgt die Prüfung des endgültigen Entwurfs der Tagesordnung , wie er nach Artikel 110 der Geschäftsordnung am Donnerstag , dem 13. Januar von der Konferenz der Präsidenten festgelegt wurde .\n",
      "Zu Montag und Dienstag liegen keine Änderungen vor .\n",
      "Zum Mittwoch : Die Sozialdemokratische Fraktion beantragt , eine Erklärung der Kommission über ihre strategischen Ziele für die nächsten fünf Jahre sowie über die Verwaltungsreform der Kommission in die Tagesordnung aufzunehmen .\n",
      "Ich bitte den Antragsteller , Herrn Barón Crespo , seinen Antrag zu begründen , falls er dies wünscht .\n",
      "Danach verfahren wir wie üblich : ein Redner dafür , einer dagegen .\n",
      "Frau Präsidentin !\n",
      "Die Vorstellung des politischen Programms der Kommission Prodi für die gesamte Wahlperiode ging auf einen Vorschlag der Fraktion der Sozialdemokratischen Partei Europas zurück , der die einhellige Billigung der Konferenz der Präsidenten im September und auch die ausdrückliche Zustimmung von Präsident Prodi fand , der seine Zusage in seiner Antrittsrede bekräftigte .\n",
      "Diese Zusage ist insofern von Bedeutung , als die Kommission ein Organ ist , das nach den Verträgen das Initiativmonopol besitzt und somit grundlegend die politische und legislative Tätigkeit dieses Parlaments in den nächsten fünf Jahren gestaltet .\n",
      "Ich möchte auch daran erinnern , daß dieses Parlament in der vorangegangenen Wahlperiode Präsident Prodi zweimal sein Vertrauen ausgesprochen hat ; in dieser Wahlperiode sprach es ihm im Juli erneut sein Vertrauen aus , und dann , als die neue Kommission im Amt war , gab es im September erneut ein Vertrauensvotum für die Kommission insgesamt .\n",
      "Somit hatte die Kommission bereits genügend Zeit , ihr Programm zu erarbeiten , und wir , um es kennenlernen und den Bürgern erklären zu können .\n",
      "In diesem Sinne erinnere ich an die Entschließung vom 15. September , in der empfohlen wurde , den Vorschlag in der kürzestmöglichen Frist vorzulegen .\n",
      "Die Ereignisse der vergangenen Woche - die am Rande der Konferenz der Präsidenten ihren Anfang nahmen und wobei diese Konferenz nur zur Bestätigung und Ratifizierung von außerhalb gefaßten Beschlüssen genutzt wurde - verdeutlichen ein Dilemma : Entweder ist die Kommission nicht in der Lage , dieses Programm vorzulegen ( In diesem Fall sollte sie eine Klärung herbeiführen .\n",
      "Nach den Worten ihres Präsidenten ist sie dazu in der Lage .\n",
      "Da die Kommission durch die Vizepräsidentin , Frau de Palacio , vertreten ist , halte ich es für zweckmäßig , vor der Abstimmung die Position der Kommission hinsichtlich ihrer Bereitschaft zur Vorstellung des Programms , so wie es vereinbart war , zu erfahren . ) , oder das Parlament ist zur Prüfung dieses Programms nicht in der Lage , wie einige offenbar vorgeben .\n",
      "Nach meiner Ansicht würde diese zweite Hypothese einem Verzicht auf unsere Verantwortung als Parlament und darüber hinaus dem Aufwerfen einer originellen These , einer unbekannten Methode gleichkommen , die darin bestände , den Fraktionen die programmatische Rede der Kommission in schriftlicher Form eine Woche vorher - und nicht , wie vereinbart , am Tag zuvor - zur Kenntnis zu geben , wobei zu berücksichtigen ist , daß das Legislativprogramm im Februar diskutiert werden wird , so daß wir auf die Aussprache verzichten könnten , da die Presse und das Internet am Tag darauf alle Bürger darüber informiert haben würden und das Parlament keinen Grund mehr hätte , sich mit der Angelegenheit zu befassen .\n",
      "Da meine Fraktion der Meinung ist , daß ein Parlament dazu da ist , zuzuhören , zu diskutieren und nachzudenken , gibt es unserer Ansicht nach keinen Grund zur Rechtfertigung dieser Verzögerung , und wir glauben , wenn die Kommission dazu in der Lage ist , liegen wir genau in der Zeit , um die ursprüngliche Vereinbarung zwischen dem Parlament und der Kommission wieder in Kraft zu setzen und verantwortungsbewußt vor unsere Mitbürgerinnen und Mitbürgern treten zu können .\n",
      "Deshalb besteht der Vorschlag der Fraktion der Sozialdemokratischen Partei Europas , den Sie erwähnt haben , darin , den Mittwoch als Termin der Vorstellung des Programms der Kommission Prodi für die Wahlperiode beizubehalten , und in dieses Programm auch das Verwaltungsreformprojekt einzubeziehen , da wir andernfalls in eine paradoxe Situation geraten könnten : Mit der Ausrede , der Wortlaut liege nicht vor , wird einerseits dem Präsidenten der Kommission das Recht abgesprochen , in diesem Parlament zu sprechen , und andererseits würde eine Aussprache über die Reform stattfinden , ohne daß dieses Parlament zuvor die Texte lesen konnte , die der Aussprache zugrunde liegen .\n",
      "Daher bitte ich Sie , Frau Präsidentin , die Kommission zu ersuchen , sich jetzt zu äußern , und danach zur Abstimmung zu schreiten .\n",

      "Wir haben dann abgestimmt .\n",
      "Jeder Vorsitzende bzw. jede Vorsitzende hat ja so viele Stimmen , wie die Fraktion Mitglieder hat .\n",
      "Es gab eine Abstimmung zu diesem Punkt .\n",
      "Diese Abstimmung ist meiner Erinnerung nach so ausgegangen : 422 gegen 180 Stimmen bei einigen wenigen Enthaltungen .\n",
      "Das heißt , alle Fraktionen , mit Ausnahme der Fraktionslosen - aber die sind ja keine Fraktion - waren sich einig , nur Ihre Fraktion war der Meinung , so zu verfahren , wie Sie es hier vorgeschlagen haben .\n",
      "Alle anderen waren anderer Meinung .\n",
      "Das war der Beschluß .\n",
      "Jetzt möchte ich zur Sache selbst etwas sagen .\n",
      "Wir haben Vertrauen zur Kommission , zu Romano Prodi , und die ganz große Mehrheit unserer Fraktion hat Romano Prodi und der Kommission nach einem schwierigen Prozeß , wie jeder weiß , das Vertrauen ausgesprochen .\n",
      "Aber wir sind auch der Meinung , daß wir eine Debatte über diese Strategie der Kommission in einem geordneten Verfahren führen müssen , nicht nur aufgrund einer mündlichen Erklärung hier im Europäischen Parlament , sondern auch aufgrund eines Dokumentes , das in der Kommission beschlossen ist und dieses Programm für fünf Jahre beschreibt .\n",
      "Ein solches Dokument gibt es nicht !\n",
      "Die Kommission wird das Programm für das Jahr 2000 im Februar vorlegen .\n",
      "Wir haben gesagt , o. k , wenn die Kommission das Programm 2000 noch nicht im Januar machen will , dann machen wir das im Februar .\n",
      "Wir haben dem zugestimmt .\n",
      "Wir wollen ja an sich keinen Streit mit der Kommission , sondern wir sind der Meinung , wenn es eben geht , müssen Kommission und Parlament einen gemeinsamen Weg gehen .\n",
      "Aber wir als Parlament sind auch der Kontrolleur der Kommission .\n",
      "Und nicht alles , was von der Kommission kommt , muß unsere Meinung sein .\n",
      "Ich möchte , daß wir uns auf eine Debatte über das Fünfjahresprogramm in den Fraktionen vernünftig vorbereiten können .\n",
      "Man kann sich nicht vorbereiten , wenn man hier eine Erklärung hört und gar nicht weiß , was Inhalt einer solchen Erklärung ist .\n",
      "Deswegen ist es unsere Empfehlung - und mein Eindruck ist , daß die Kommission auch aufgeschlossen ist für diesen Gedanken - , daß wir im Februar die Debatte über das langfristige Programm der Kommission bis zum Jahre 2005 führen - ich hoffe , die Kommission wird sich bis dahin auch auf ein Programm verständigen , das sie uns vorschlagen wird - , und daß wir gleichzeitig im Februar auch die Debatte über das Legislativprogramm der Kommission für das Jahr 2000 führen .\n",
      "Es ist also auch ein vernünftiger sachlicher Zusammenhang , der uns rät , die Debatte über beide Programme gemeinsam zu führen .\n",

      "Deshalb respektieren wir die Entscheidungen des Parlaments in diesem Sinne .\n",
      "Aber ich möchte auch ganz deutlich zum Ausdruck bringen , daß sich Präsident Prodi gegenüber dem Parlament , wie Herr Barón in Erinnerung brachte , zu einer neuen Aussprache verpflichtet hat , die zusätzlich zu der Jahresaussprache über das Legislativprogramm der Kommission , über die großen Aktionslinien für den nächsten Fünfjahreszeitraum , das heißt , für diese Wahlperiode , stattfinden soll .\n",
      "Ich möchte sagen , daß diese Aussprache in der im September getroffenen Vereinbarung von der Jahresvorlage des Legislativprogramms der Kommission abgetrennt wurde .\n",
      "Und ich möchte auch sagen , daß wir seitens der Kommission auf diese Aussprache vorbereitet und bereit sind , sie zum geeigneten Zeitpunkt zu führen , daß wir für diese Woche darauf vorbereitet waren , wie dies grundsätzlich vereinbart war , wobei man am Vorabend vor den Fraktionen des Parlaments mit einer Rede auftreten wollte .\n",
      "Deshalb , Frau Präsidentin , möchte ich bekräftigen , daß wir unsererseits das Aktionsprogramm für die nächsten fünf Jahre diskutiert haben und darauf vorbereitet sind , sofern es vom Parlament so beschlossen wird - noch in dieser Woche , wenn der Beschluß so lautet - , das Fünfjahresprogramm und im nächsten Monat das Programm für das Jahr 2000 , genau so wie vereinbart , vorzustellen .\n",

      "Verehrte Frau Kommissarin , verehrte Präsidentin , liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen !\n",
      "Ich begrüße den Gemeinsamen Standpunkt des Rates zur Harmonisierung der Ausbildung von Sicherheitsberatern für die Beförderung gefährlicher Güter auf Straße , Schiene oder Binnenwasserstraße unumwunden .\n",
      "Erstens : Wir mußten formal tätig werden , um den Forderungen der Richtlinie 96 / 35 / EG gerecht zu werden , die die Mitgliedstaaten zur Einsetzung von Gefahrgutbeauftragten bzw. Sicherheitsberatern sowie zur Organisation von Ausbildung , Schulung und Prüfung eben dieser Personen verpflichtet , ohne dies explizit auszuführen .\n",
      "Zweitens : Wir erzielen mit dieser Richtlinie a ) ein Mehr an Sicherheit , sowohl bei der Beförderung als auch beim Umschlag von gefährlichen Gütern ; b ) einen Abbau von Wettbewerbsverzerrungen infolge unterschiedlichster nationaler Ausbildungsstrukturen und Ausbildungskosten sowie c ) die Herstellung der Chancengleichheit von Sicherheitsberatern auf dem europäischen Arbeitsmarkt .\n",
      "Drittens garantieren wir mit der Richtlinie , so wie sie jetzt als Gemeinsamer Standpunkt vorliegt , insbesondere da sie sich ausschließlich auf Mindestnormen beschränkt , einen hohen Flexibilitätsgrad und geringe Reglementierung durch die Europäische Union , und wir tragen zur hohen Eigenverantwortung der Mitgliedstaaten bei .\n",
      "All dies ist im Sinne der Subsidiarität außerordentlich zu begrüßen .\n",
      "Unsere Änderungsanträge aus der ersten Lesung halte ich für sehr zufriedenstellend berücksichtigt .\n",
      "Sie wurden übernommen , sinngemäß umgesetzt bzw. sie entfielen , weil die entsprechenden europäischen Regelungen nicht aufgenommen wurden , z. B. ein Sanktionssystem bei Verstößen oder eine komplizierte Blockbildung von Fragenkomplexen .\n",
      "Für den einen einstimmig angenommenen Änderungsantrag des Ausschusses für Regionalpolitik und Verkehr , der die zeitliche Umsetzung der Richtlinie betrifft , bitte ich um Zustimmung .\n",
      "Indem wir den Mitgliedstaaten für die Umsetzung der Richtlinie kein spezifisches Datum setzen , sondern ihnen einen Zeitraum von drei Monaten nach Inkrafttreten der Richtlinie zugestehen , führen wir eine Flexibilitätsklausel ein , die eine unverzügliche Umsetzung gewährleistet .\n",
      "Ich bitte Sie um Zustimmung .\n",
      "Frau Präsidentin !\n",
      "Wir können und dürfen uns nicht damit abfinden , immer häufiger von Unfällen zu hören , bei denen auf der Straße , aber auch auf der Schiene oder auf Wasserwegen große Schäden entstehen , nicht nur , aber auch , weil die Betroffenen den Transit von gefährlichen Gütern nicht ernst genug nehmen oder weil durch Unwissen oder aufgrund mangelnder Ausbildung der Fahrer oder sonstiger Verantwortlicher für die diversen Verkehrsmittel aus einem kleinen Unfall allzu oft eine große Katastrophe geworden ist .\n",
      "Mir als Österreicher , aber ich glaube , uns allen ist noch die Katastrophe in lebendiger Erinnerung , die im vergangenen Jahr im Tauerntunnel zahlreiche Menschenleben gekostet hat und wo anschließend viele Monate lang mit gigantischem finanziellem Aufwand wiederaufgebaut werden mußte , was bei diesem Brand im Tunnel zerstört worden ist .\n",
      "Die monatelange Renovierung hat diesen wichtigen Verkehrsweg zwischen dem Norden und dem Süden Europas abgeschnitten .\n",
      "Der dadurch bewirkte Umwegsverkehr hat viele Tausend EU-Bürger bis an die Grenze des Erträglichen belastet .\n",
      "Es war in einzelnen Gemeinden in meinem Land wirklich die Hölle los .\n",
      "Prävention muß unsere Antwort auf derartige Katastrophen sein , und mit dem vorliegenden Richtlinienentwurf schaffen wir eine wichtige Grundlage dafür , daß gut ausgebildete Sicherheitsbeauftragte zur Verfügung stehen , damit rechtzeitig das Richtige getan wird .\n",
      "Wir dürfen uns freilich nicht damit begnügen , europäisches Recht im Dienste von mehr Sicherheit zu schaffen .\n",
      "Wir müssen auch konsequent darauf achten , daß unsere Vorgaben fristgerecht durch die Mitgliedstaaten umgesetzt werden , und noch wichtiger , wir müssen darauf achten , daß sie anschließend auch angewendet werden .\n",
      "Bitte nicht noch einen weiteren Bereich , in dem wir dann anschließend das Vollzugsdefizit beklagen müssen .\n",
      "Einen letzten Punkt möchte ich noch ansprechen : Wir dürfen uns nicht damit begnügen , eine weitere Lücke im Sicherheitsnetz zu schließen und die Augen davor zu verschließen , daß beim Thema Verkehrssicherheit in Europa noch viel mehr zu tun ist .\n",
      "Ich verlange in diesem Zusammenhang auch und bitte die anwesende zuständige Kommissarin , möglichst bald einen entsprechenden Text vorzulegen , um auch in Zukunft für mehr Sicherheit im Tunnelverkehr zu sorgen , damit wir in Europa solche Katastrophen nicht mehr in diesem Ausmaß erleben müssen !\n",
      "Frau Präsidentin , zunächst möchte ich Herrn Koch für seinen Bericht danken , der die Verkehrssicherheit zum Thema hat .\n",
      "Der Bericht befaßt sich mit der Harmonisierung von Prüfungsanforderungen für Sicherheitsberater , die im Bereich der Beförderung gefährlicher Güter auf Straße , Schiene oder Binnenwasserstraße tätig sind .\n",
      "Ich beglückwünsche ihn zu seinem ausgezeichneten Bericht .\n",
      "Die Verkehrssicherheit bestimmte in letzter Zeit häufig die Negativschlagzeilen : Das Eisenbahnunglück nahe dem Londoner Bahnhof Paddington , das furchtbare Eisenbahnunglück in Norwegen , zwei Flugzeugabstürze , bei denen EU-Bürger zu Schaden kamen , und die von der Erika vor der bretonischen Küste verursachte Naturkatastrophe sind Ereignisse , die allein in den letzten vier Monaten zu verzeichnen waren .\n",
      "Sie machen deutlich , daß Verkehrssicherheit keine Selbstverständlichkeit ist und daß diejenigen , die für den Schutz der Öffentlichkeit verantwortlich sind , hochmotiviert und hochqualifiziert sein müssen .\n",
      "Der Berichterstatter stellte fest , daß der Rat in seinem Gemeinsamen Standpunkt sechs der zehn vom Parlament in der ersten Lesung angenommenen Änderungen übernommen hat und daß die übrigen Änderungen des Parlaments im wesentlichen berücksichtigt worden sind .\n",
      "Meine Fraktion wird den Gemeinsamen Standpunkt daher unterstützen und begrüßt die baldige Umsetzung der Regelung , die ein weiteres Instrument im Kampf um die maximale Erhöhung der Verkehrssicherheit in der EU darstellen wird .\n",
      "Initiativen zur Erhöhung der Verkehrssicherheit werden jederzeit von meiner Fraktion unterstützt .\n",
      "Wie die jüngsten Ereignisse zeigen , gibt es in diesem Bereich noch sehr viel zu tun .\n",
      "Frau Präsidentin , gestatten Sie mir einige Bemerkungen .\n",
      "Danken möchte ich sowohl dem Berichterstatter für seinen überaus akribischen und sachkundigen Bericht als auch der Kommission für den von ihr eingebrachten Vorschlag .\n",
      "Es geht um die Angleichung der Prüfungsvorschriften , eigentlich aber auch um Mindestnormen .\n",
      "In gewissem Sinne bedauere ich das .\n",
      "Selbstverständlich kommt der Verkehrssicherheit auf Straße , Schiene oder Binnenwasserstraßen überaus große Bedeutung zu , und angesichts des internationalen Charakters dieser Transporte ist es erforderlich , die Ausbildungsgänge für Sicherheitsberater sowie die Anforderungen beispielsweise im kommenden neuen ADR zu harmonisieren .\n",
      "Das halte ich ebenso wie die Umsetzung für wichtig .\n",
      "Natürlich gibt es gute Gründe , weshalb wir diesem Problem besondere Aufmerksamkeit widmen müssen .\n",
      "Denken Sie an die Unfälle , die sich in den letzten Jahren im Straßenverkehr ereignet haben .\n",
      "Beispielsweise in Belgien , den Niederlanden und weiteren Ländern fuhren Gefahrguttransporter trotz Nebels weiter und wurden nicht , wie es angesichts der Umstände eigentlich erforderlich gewesen wäre , am Straßenrand abgestellt .\n",
      "Oder denken Sie an Schiffer von osteuropäischen Schiffen , die hier neben anderen ankern und von denen ganz offensichtlich Gefahren ausgehen .\n",
      "Außerdem belegen Kontrollen in belgischen , finnischen wie auch in japanischen Häfen , daß 50 % der Container mit zum Teil gefährlicher Ladung nicht ordnungsgemäß angeliefert werden .\n",
      "Kurzum , ein ernstes Problem .\n",
      "Was die Sicherheitsberater betrifft , so ist in einigen Ländern seit dem 1. Januar dieses Jahres ein solcher Berater in den Unternehmen vorgeschrieben .\n",
      "Die Umsetzung ist gegenwärtig insbesondere in kleinen Betrieben mit Schwierigkeiten verbunden , denn sie können sich eine solche Stelle nicht leisten .\n",
      "Entweder sie verkaufen ihre Ladung oder mischen sie mit anderer Ladung , was zu einer Reihe von Problemen führt .\n",
      "Gefordert werden deshalb auch die Erfassung dieser Aktivitäten in Form von Jahresberichten oder Betriebsanalysen und eventuell die Einbeziehung in die Zertifizierung nach ISO 9002 .\n",
      "Die eigentliche Arbeit ist getan , nun geht es um die Umsetzung .\n",
      "Gestatten Sie mir noch einen letzten Hinweis .\n",
      "Im Hinblick auf diese Umsetzung müssen wir außerdem angemessene Vereinbarungen mit den osteuropäischen Ländern treffen , da sie erst ab 1. Juli 2001 , also in anderthalb Jahren , den entsprechenden Übereinkommen beitreten werden .\n",
      "Dadurch erwachsen ihnen vorübergehend Wettbewerbsvorteile .\n",
      "Obgleich ich das an sich nicht schlimm finde , sollten wir insbesondere den Sicherheitsaspekten des Gefahrguttransports auf Straße , Schiene und Binnenwasserstraßen Priorität einräumen , diesen Teil des Besitzstands so bald als möglich aufgreifen und den beitrittswilligen Staaten vorlegen .\n",
      "Frau Präsidentin , zu Recht befaßt sich das Parlament regelmäßig mit der Verkehrssicherheit .\n",
      "Die ständig zunehmende Menge an Gütern , die durch Europa befördert werden , stellt offen oder versteckt eine Gefahr für das Personal und die Gesellschaft dar .\n",
      "Personen , die mit dieser Gefahr konfrontiert sind , haben deshalb hohen Anforderungen zu genügen .\n",
      "Mit den dazu in einer anderen Richtlinie , 95 / 35 / EG , verankerten Normen sollten Menschen verantwortungsbewußt über die Beförderung gefährlicher Güter beraten werden können .\n",
      "Zu meiner Freude besteht auch mit dem Rat Übereinstimmung über Mindestanforderungen für deren Prüfung , obgleich ich mit dem Ziel international gleichwertiger Befähigungsnachweise einheitliche verbindliche Normen und Regelungen bevorzugt hätte .\n",
      "Allerdings scheint das nicht machbar zu sein .\n",
      "Summa summarum halte ich den von dem Berichterstatter eingebrachten Abänderungsantrag in jeder Hinsicht für logisch und kann ihn deshalb voll und ganz unterstützen .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Frau Kommissarin , liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen !\n",
      "Ich möchte zuerst dem Kollegen Koch zu seinen Berichten gratulieren , die vielleicht technische Berichte sind , aber für die Sicherheit von sehr großer Bedeutung sind .\n",
      "Ich möchte nur wenige Anmerkungen machen .\n",
      "Zuerst möchte ich die Frau Kommissarin bitten - und ich bin überzeugt , daß mein Wunsch auf fruchtbaren Boden fällt - , daß man der Frage der Sicherheit , ob auf der Straße , auf den Wasserwegen oder auf dem Meer , erhöhte Aufmerksamkeit schenkt .\n",
      "Wenn ich sehe , daß der erste Antrag der Kommission am 19. März 1998 gestellt wurde und wir uns heute damit beschäftigen - wobei das Parlament relativ rasch reagiert hat - , dann ist dieser Zeitraum etwas zu lang .\n",
      "Das ist jetzt nicht allein die Schuld der Kommission , aber ich glaube , daß wir rascher reagieren müssen , um hier auch zu einer Harmonisierung zu kommen .\n",
      "Der zweite Punkt wurde bereits erwähnt : die Mindestnormen .\n",
      "Ich bin grundsätzlich der Meinung , daß wir in vielen Verkehrsbereichen erhöhte Flexibilität und länderweise Regelungen anstreben sollten .\n",
      "Bei der Sicherheit bin ich schon etwas skeptisch , weil sich die Sicherheit etwa in Schweden im Grundsatz nicht von der in Deutschland , Italien oder Österreich unterscheidet .\n",
      "Ich kann mit diesen Mindestnormen leben , aber ich bitte die Kommission , die Dinge wirklich aufmerksam zu verfolgen .\n",
      "Falls diese Art der Flexibilität zu ungenügenden Regelungen in einigen Ländern führen sollte , dann sollten wir eine weitere Harmonisierung vornehmen .\n",
      "Der dritte Punkt wurde auch schon erwähnt .\n",
      "Ich komme ja ähnlich wie der Kollege Rack aus einem Transitland , wo diese Frage eine besondere Rolle spielt .\n",
      "Wir wollen die Wettbewerbsbedingungen nicht einseitig für einige Länder verschlechtern und für Länder wie Österreich oder andere Transitländer verbessern .\n",
      "Aber ich glaube , daß wir alles unternehmen sollten , um den Transport gefährlicher Güter so gering wie möglich zu halten , und zwar in allen Ländern , ob Transitländer oder nicht .\n",
      "Herr Präsident !\n",
      "In erster Linie möchte ich den Berichterstatter , Herrn Koch , zu seiner großartigen Arbeit und seiner konstruktiven Zusammenarbeit mit der Kommission bei der Verbesserung der Texte , der Vorlage dieses Berichts und dieses Vorschlags beglückwünschen ; letztendlich gibt es nur einen Änderungsantrag in bezug auf die Anforderungen an die Prüfungsvorschriften für Sicherheitsberater für die Beförderung gefährlicher Güter auf Straße , Schiene oder Binnenwasserstraßen .\n",
      "Unserer Auffassung nach ist die Zusammenarbeit , die gemeinsame Arbeit der beiden Institutionen - Parlament und Kommission - wichtig , und die mit dem Ausschuß für Regionalpolitik bestehende Zusammenarbeit , konkret mit der Gruppe für Verkehr , ist hervorragend .\n",
      "In den gemeinsamen Standpunkt wurden praktisch alle von der Kommission akzeptierten Änderungsanträge übernommen , die Mindestanforderungen an die Prüfungen für die Sicherheitsberater wurden harmonisiert , und in zweiter Lesung können wir den Änderungsantrag zum vorgeschlagenen Zeitpunkt annehmen , der viel realistischer ist als der anfangs von der Kommission vorgeschlagene , wenn man bedenkt , daß wir schon mehrere Jahre über diese Frage diskutieren .\n",
      "In ganz kurzen Worten möchte ich auch für die Beiträge der verschiedenen Abgeordneten danken und Ihnen , meine Damen und Herren , sagen , daß die Kommission der Sicherheit im Verkehrswesen Priorität einräumt .\n",
      "Und wie Herr Simpson sehr richtig sagte , darf der Prozeß niemals als abgeschlossen , als gewonnen oder als vollendet betrachtet werden .\n",
      "Der Prozeß zur Erhöhung der Sicherheitsmargen und -garantien im Verkehrswesen ist ein Prozeß , der täglich vervollkommnet werden muß .\n",
      "In diesem Zusammenhang möchte ich auch ganz kurz auf die Probleme hinsichtlich der Tunnel eingehen , die von den Herren Rack und Swoboda angesprochen wurden und die im Falle Österreichs zweifellos ein sehr sensibles Thema sind , weshalb Anstrengungen unternommen werden müssen , um Möglichkeiten zur Erhöhung der Sicherheit zu finden .\n",
      "Bei einem der großen Unfälle in jüngster Zeit war nicht die Ladung an sich gefährlich .\n",
      "Die Margarine und ein paar Kilo Farbe , die im Prinzip kein Risiko darstellten , verursachten eine echte Katastrophe .\n",
      "Deshalb muß geprüft werden , wie die Anforderungen zur Gewährleistung eines Maximums an Sicherheit noch optimiert werden können .\n",
      "Abschließend möchte ich sagen , daß es um die Sicherheit bei allen Transportarten geht .\n",
      "In dieser Woche werden wir hier aufgrund der Katastrophe der Erika eine Aussprache über die Sicherheit des Seeverkehrs führen , und wir müssen im Laufe dieses Jahres auch über die Sicherheitsziele im Luftverkehr diskutieren .\n",
      "Ich will zum Ausdruck bringen , daß die Sicherheit ein vorrangiges Ziel der Kommission ist .\n",
      "Wie ich in der Aussprache über die Erika sagen werde , warten wir nicht auf eine Katastrophe , um uns mit dem Sicherheitsaspekt zu befassen , sondern wir arbeiten daran am Rande dieser Geschehnisse .\n",
      "Diese führen uns allerdings die Dringlichkeit einer effektiven Antwort auf Probleme dieser Art vor Augen .\n",
      "Ich möchte nochmals allen Rednern und ganz besonders dem Berichterstatter , Herrn Koch , meinen Dank sagen .\n",
      "Die Aussprache ist geschlossen .\n",
      "Die Abstimmung findet morgen um 12.00 Uhr statt .\n",
      " \n",
      "Gefahrguttransport auf der Straße Nach der Tagesordnung folgt der Bericht ( A5-0104 / 1999 ) von Herrn Koch im Namen des Ausschusses für Regionalpolitik , Verkehr und Fremdenverkehr für eine Richtlinie des Europäischen Parlament und des Rates ( KOM ( 1999 ) 158 - C5-0004 / 1999 - 1999 / 0083 ( COD ) ) zur Änderung der Richtlinie 94 / 55 / EG zur Angleichung der Rechtsvorschriften der Mitgliedstaaten für den Gefahrguttransport auf der Straße .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , verehrte Frau Kommissarin , liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen !\n",
      "Die am 1. Januar 1997 in Kraft getretene Richtlinie zur Angleichung von Rechtsvorschriften der Mitgliedstaaten für Gefahrguttransporte auf der Straße beinhaltet einige Übergangsvorschriften , deren Gültigkeit befristet und an den Abschluß bestimmter Normungsarbeiten des CEN , also des Europäischen Komitees für Normung , gekoppelt ist .\n",
      "Aufgetretene Verzögerungen bei den Arbeiten des CEN führen nun zu Problemen bei der Anwendung eben dieser Richtlinie .\n",
      "Insbesondere können Anhänge nicht entsprechend der technischen und industriellen Entwicklung angepaßt werden .\n",
      "Ich bedauere dies , denn wir müssen tätig werden , weil andere ihre Arbeit nicht gemacht haben .\n",
      "Insofern akzeptiere ich den vorliegenden und heute zur Diskussion stehenden Vorschlag zur Änderung der Richtlinie 94 / 55 / EG .\n",
      "Ein Nichttätigwerden der Europäischen Union würde die Mitgliedstaten verpflichten , ihre innerstaatlichen Rechtsvorschriften für einen kurzen Zeitraum , nämlich bis zum Abschluß der Arbeiten des CEN , zu ändern , was unnötige Kosten und Verunsicherungen verursacht .\n",
      "Die auf der heutigen Tagesordnung stehende Änderung der Richtlinie bewirkt also keine Änderung der in der Gemeinschaft bestehenden Harmonisierung der Gefahrguttransporte .\n",
      "Sie verlängert lediglich Übergangsregeln durch das Verschieben von Terminen , sie streicht nicht mehr zutreffende Bestimmungen , und sie regelt die Verfahren für a ) Ad hoc-Beförderungen gefährlicher Güter sowie b ) den Erlaß weniger strenger nationaler Vorschriften , insbesondere bei der Beförderung sehr geringer Gefahrgutmengen auf lokal streng begrenzten Gebieten .\n",
      "Somit liegt die Änderung der Richtlinie ganz im Sinne der Subsidiarität ; die Mitgliedstaaten erhalten mehr Befugnisse .\n",
      "Die EU-Kommission entscheidet , ob die Mitgliedstaaten bestimmte eigene Vorschriften erlassen können .\n",
      "Sie wird dabei von einem Expertenausschuß für Gefahrguttransporte nach dem Regelungsverfahren unterstützt .\n",
      "Die Modalitäten für die Ausübung dieser der Kommission übertragenen Durchführungsbefugnisse wurden durch Ratsbeschluß vom Juni 1999 neu geregelt .\n",
      "Der heute zur Diskussion stehende Vorschlag für eine Änderung der Richtlinie betreffend Gefahrguttransporte auf der Straße stammt jedoch vom Mai 1999 und konnte somit das aktuelle Komitologieverfahren noch nicht berücksichtigen .\n",
      "Die eingereichten und vom Ausschuß einstimmig angenommenen Änderungsanträge beziehen sich in zwei Fällen auf eben dieses veränderte Komitologieverfahren .\n",
      "Wir möchten sicherstellen , daß hierauf bereits in den Erwägungsgründen hingewiesen wird und die uneindeutig formulierte Frist , innerhalb der der Rat eine Entscheidung treffen muß , auf maximal drei Monate fixiert wird .\n",
      "Darüber hinaus wird auf die Notwendigkeit einer verstärkten Transparenz hingewiesen .\n",
      "Ein weiterer Änderungsantrag erlaubt es den Mitgliedstaaten , schärfere Forderungen , insbesondere für Vakuumtanks , zu erlassen , wenn vorrangig bei Temperaturen weit unter minus 20º C gearbeitet bzw. transportiert wird .\n",
      "Dies liegt im besonderen Interesse nordeuropäischer Regionen .\n",
      "Ein letzter Änderungsantrag soll bewirken , daß die Nutzung der zwischen dem 1. Januar 1997 und dem Inkrafttreten dieser Richtlinie in Betrieb genommenen Tanks und Tankfahrzeuge auch weiterhin erlaubt ist , wenn sie entsprechend konstruiert und gewartet worden sind .\n",
      "Gleichwohl wissend , daß dies nur ein kleiner Schritt zu mehr Verkehrssicherheit ist , bitte ich Sie um die Zustimmung zu diesem Bericht .\n",
      "Herr Präsident !\n",
      "Sehr geehrte Kollegen !\n",
      "Ich wünsche Ihnen ein gutes neues Jahr und Millennium .\n",
      "Ich spreche heute zum ersten Mal im Plenum und finde das ganz schön aufregend , ein wenig wie bei der ersten Liebe , nur daß die gewöhnlich länger als zwei Minuten dauert .\n",
      "Ich möchte den Vorschlag der Kommission zur Änderung der Richtlinie über Gefahrguttransporte auf der Straße aus meiner Sicht kurz kommentieren .\n",
      "Ich halte es für gut , diese Richtlinie jetzt zu erlassen , weil anderenfalls die Mitgliedstaaten ihre Rechtsvorschriften für einen sehr kurzen Zeitraum , eine Übergangsphase , ändern müßten , was einerseits unnötige Kosten verursachen und andererseits wieder einmal Verdruß bei den Bürgern über die Bürokratie der EU hervorrufen würde .\n",
      "In dem Vorschlag der Kommission werden jedoch nicht alle relevanten Fragen berücksichtigt , wie beispielsweise die kalten klimatischen Bedingungen in den nördlichen Regionen .\n",
      "Deshalb habe ich einige Änderungsanträge zu dem grundsätzlich ausgezeichneten Bericht von Herrn Koch eingebracht , die in unserem Ausschuß angenommen worden sind .\n",
      "Meine Änderungsanträge betreffen die Frostbeständigkeit der Transportbehälter für Gefahrgut .\n",
      "Nach dem Vorschlag der Kommission wäre ein Grenzwert von -20 ºC ausreichend .\n",
      "Am Mittelmeer kann man sich schwer vorstellen , daß der Frost in Lappland erheblich niedrigere Temperaturen erreicht .\n",
      "Auch in Lappland wird die EU befürwortet , so daß wir hier auch an die Menschen dort denken müssen .\n",
      "Deshalb habe ich vorgeschlagen , den Grenzwert für Frost auf -40 ºC herabzusetzen .\n",
      "Das wäre auch erforderlich , um das Sicherheitsniveau in den nördlichen Regionen beizubehalten .\n",
      "Ich hoffe , daß mein Vorschlag in der morgigen Abstimmung Berücksichtigung findet .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , wenn Sie erlauben , möchte ich Ihnen erst einmal meinen Respekt dafür ausdrücken , wie Sie vorhin während der Debatte den fliegenden Wechsel im Vorsitz vollzogen haben .\n",
      "Ich fand das ganz hervorragend .\n",
      "Zum Thema : Ich denke , die Bürger Europas müssen sich darauf verlassen können , daß das , was auf Europas Straßen , Schienen usw. transportiert wird , wenn es denn auch noch gefährliche Güter sind , so sicher wie möglich ist .\n",
      "Diese Richtlinie ist ein Beitrag dazu .\n",
      "Das , was wir heute machen , ist im Grunde genommen ein Ärgernis .\n",
      "Der Berichterstatter Koch , dem wir unseren Dank für seine Arbeit , die er dabei geleistet hat , aussprechen , hat darauf hingewiesen , daß im Grunde genommen alles schon etwas weiter sein könnte , wenn es nicht dieses Versäumnis der CEN gäbe , die in der Erstellung und dem Angleichen der Richtlinie sehr säumig sind .\n",
      "Deswegen können wir nur hoffen - und wir sollten das in dieser Woche alles beschließen - , daß wir dann 2001 endlich gemeinschaftliche Regelungen für den Gefahrguttransport auf der Straße haben , so daß wir hier ein Stück Rechtssicherheit und auch ein Stück mehr Sicherheit auf unseren Straßen haben .\n",
      "Frau Kommissarin , Herr Präsident !\n",
      "Ich danke zuerst Herrn Koch für seinen Bericht , den ich exzellent finde und dem ich auch nicht allzuviel hinzufügen möchte .\n",
      "Ich möchte bei dieser Gelegenheit nur darauf hinweisen , daß nicht nur in Indien , woher ich gerade komme , sondern auch in der EU der Gefahrentransport nach wie vor große Probleme mit sich bringt .\n",
      "Wir brauchen nur an den schweren Unfall im Mont-Blanc-Tunnel vor etwa einem Jahr zu denken - auch der Tauerntunnel gehört dazu .\n",
      "Wir merken , daß es immer dort , wo es Naturschwierigkeiten gibt - Nebel , Stürme , Kälte - und vor allem auch in den Engpässen in den Alpen immer noch zu großen Problemen in diesem Zusammenhang kommen kann .\n",
      "Ich plädiere generell dafür , daß gefährliche Güter mehr auf die Schiene verlegt werden .\n",
      "In diesem Zusammenhang muß präventiv bei der Planung zukünftiger Stränge - Schiene oder auch Autobahn - bereits die richtige Lösung für die Zukunft eingeplant werden .\n",
      "Denken wir an den Brenner-Basistunnel , der noch nicht hintergründig diskutiert wurde .\n",
      "In diesem Zusammenhang möchte ich auch darauf hinweisen und die Kommission bitten , das ernst zu nehmen , daß die Verkehrsproblematik zu den Schlüsselfragen der EU gehört .\n",
      "Wir müssen viel intensiver und nachhaltiger über Transportvermeidung , über Schwerverkehr auf die Schiene , über road pricing und Privatisierung der Schiene reden , um die Funktionalität zu verbessern .\n",
      "Wenn ich bedenke , daß die Osterweiterung einige Probleme mehr bringen wird , dann wird uns allen klar , daß die Glaubwürdigkeit der EU in Zukunft auch daran gemessen wird , ob und wie wir den Verkehr geregelt bekommen .\n",
      "Herr Präsident !\n",
      "Der Bericht , den wir heute behandeln , hat im Grunde genommen keine großen Erneuerungen zur Folge , da die meisten Abänderungsanträge rein technischer Natur sind .\n",
      "Es sollte jedoch unterstrichen werden , daß solche Beschlüsse stets einen positiven Beitrag zum Umweltschutz leisten und somit die Voraussetzungen für ein Funktionieren des Binnenmarktes verbessern .\n",
      "In der EU werden große Mengen gefährlicher Güter auf der Straße , Schiene und Wasserstraße befördert , und dafür benötigen wir effektive Rechtsvorschriften .\n",
      "Nun bekommen wir für alle möglichen Bereiche gemeinsame Mindestregelungen für die Mitgliedstaaten , was außerordentlich begrüßenswert ist .\n",
      "Ich möchte daher dem Berichterstatter , Herrn Koch , für seine Arbeit zu dieser Frage danken .\n",
      "Das ist auch für die Bedingungen des Binnenmarktes von Wichtigkeit .\n",
      "Für einen wirklich funktionierenden gemeinsamen Verkehrsmarkt brauchen wir nicht nur Rechtsvorschriften schlechthin , sondern möglichst einheitliche Vorschriften .\n",
      "Lassen Sie mich abschließend noch einen dritten Punkt kommentieren , den ich ebenfalls für sehr bedeutsam halte : den Abänderungsantrag des Abgeordneten Ari Vatanen .\n",
      "Die Voraussetzungen in den einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten sind sehr verschieden .\n",
      "Durch die Annahme dieses Antrags tragen wir der Tatsache Rechnung , daß es in den nördlichen Teilen der Union sehr kalt werden kann .\n",
      "Die Auswirkungen dieser Kälte auf Material und Verpackung darf nicht außer acht gelassen werden .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , ich betrachte es als positiv , daß diese Regelung flexibel gestaltet werden kann und hoffe , die Kommission wird diese Änderung annehmen .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , ich möchte nicht nur dem Kollegen Koch , sondern auch der Vizepräsidentin der Kommission dafür danken , daß sie sich so klar und eindeutig zur Sicherheit im Verkehrsbereich und zur Priorität der Sicherheit bekannt hat .\n",
      "Der Kollege Koch hat seinen guten Bericht gemacht , weil im CEN und auch im Rahmen der Wirtschaftskommission der Vereinten Nationen die Arbeit nicht so expeditiv gemacht wurde .\n",
      "Ich möchte die Vizepräsidentin fragen , ob sie uns heute sagen kann , wie der Stand der Dinge bei den Harmonisierungsbestrebungen dieser beiden Organisationen ist , und ob die EU die Möglichkeit hat , die Harmonisierungsbestrebungen nach möglichst einfachen Prinzipien zu beschleunigen .\n",
      "Denn es ist klar : Selbst wenn wir innerhalb der Europäischen Union eine tolle Regelung treffen , der Verkehr macht nicht Halt an diesen Grenzen , er geht darüber hinaus .\n",
      "Daher sind weitergehende , nämlich regional weitergehende Regelungen sicherlich sinnvoll .\n",
      "Wenn die Frau Kommissarin das heute nicht machen kann , wäre sie dann bereit , dem Ausschuß schriftlich den Stand der Dinge und den Stand der Verhandlungen zwischen CEN und Wirtschaftskommission zu übermitteln ?\n",
      "Herr Präsident !\n",
      "Ich möchte Herrn Koch noch einmal für seine Arbeit an diesem anderen Bericht gratulieren , der in gewisser Weise die Aussprache vom Oktober über den Schienenverkehr ergänzt .\n",
      "Wir alle bedauern , daß das Europäische Komitee für Normung ( CEN ) nicht in der Lage gewesen ist , in der geforderten Zeit die notwendige Vorschriftenänderung für eine entsprechende Harmonisierung im Geltungsbereich der Europäischen Union durchzuführen .\n",
      "Diese Aussprache und die Änderung der gegenwärtig geltenden Richtlinie ermöglichen uns die Berücksichtigung unterschiedlicher Gegebenheiten , die Ausdruck der Vielfalt unseres Europas sind .\n",
      "Vor wenigen Augenblicken sprach Herr Vatanen von Temperaturen , die nicht nur unter 20 Grad minus , sondern unter 40 Grad minus liegen .\n",
      "Natürlich akzeptieren wir diesen Änderungsantrag , er ist völlig vernünftig , und ich glaube , es müssen konkrete Situationen in Betracht gezogen werden , die von der klimatischen Verschiedenartigkeit der Europäischen Union zeugen , die manchmal bei der Prüfung der Normungen und Charakterisierungen technischer Art in spezifische Festlegungen und konkrete Anforderungen umgesetzt werden .\n",
      "Zu den Worten von Herrn Swoboda über die Tätigkeit des CEN möchte ich sagen , daß wir sie drängen , ihre Arbeit maximal zu beschleunigen , denn es wäre dramatisch , wenn wir trotz der neuen Frist nach etwas mehr als einem Jahr vor den gleichen Schwierigkeiten stehen würden , weil die Arbeiten nicht zum Abschluß gebracht wurden .\n",
      "Schließlich , Herr Präsident , sind bereits die Hauptprobleme dargelegt worden , die diese Änderung der Richtlinie rechtfertigen , wir sind auf die Verzögerung beim CEN , auf die Änderung einiger Vorschriften , auf die Übereinstimmung zwischen dem Wortlaut der Richtlinie und dem Inhalt der Anhänge sowie auf die Notwendigkeit einer stärkeren Präzisierung eingegangen .\n",
      "Alle Beiträge des parlamentarischen Ausschusses und des Berichterstatters , Herrn Koch , die in verschiedenen , konkret in vier , Änderungsanträgen zum Ausdruck kommen , werden von der Kommission aufgegriffen .\n",
      "Wir akzeptieren also die uns unterbreiteten vier Änderungsanträge .\n",
      "Die Aussprache ist geschlossen .\n",
      "Die Abstimmung findet morgen um 12.00 Uhr statt .\n",
      " \n",
      "Koordinierung Strukturfonds / Kohäsionsfonds Nach der Tagesordnung folgt der Bericht ( A5-0108 / 1999 ) von Frau Schroedter im Namen des Ausschusses für Regionalpolitik , Verkehr und Fremdenverkehr über die Mitteilung der Kommission : Die Strukturfonds und ihre Koordinierung mit dem Kohäsionsfonds - Leitlinien für die Programme des Zeitraums 2000-2006 ( KOM ( 1999 ) 344 - C5-0122 / 1999 - 1999 / 2127 ( COS ) ) .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Frau Kommissarin .\n",
      "Ah , der Herr Kommissar ist da , ich hatte schon gedacht , Sie kommen nicht .\n",
      "Willkommen in diesem Parlament !\n",
      "Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen !\n",
      "Wir können nicht darüber hinwegsehen , daß der Gewinn des Europäischen Binnenmarktes sich auf die reichen Regionen konzentriert und selbst dort nicht allen Bevölkerungsteilen zugute kommt .\n",
      "Wie lange wollen wir eigentlich so eine Entwicklung akzeptieren , die auf die zunehmende Spaltung zwischen armen und reichen Regionen hinausläuft ?\n",
      "Während im fünften Bericht über die Situation der Regionen die Arbeitslosigkeit in den armen Regionen siebenmal höher lag als in den reichen Regionen , spricht der sechste Bericht bereits von einer achtmal höheren Arbeitslosigkeit , obwohl europäische Strukturfondsmittel in die Regionen fließen .\n",
      "Deshalb wundert es natürlich niemanden , daß bereits im Vorfeld der neuen Strukturfondsverordnung die Forderung laut wird , die Mittel effizienter und konzentrierter einzusetzen für die europäischen Ziele hohes Beschäftigungsniveau und nachhaltige Entwicklung , um nur einige zu nennen .\n",
      "Das Parlament , aber vor allen Dingen die Mitgliedstaaten forderten massiv Verbesserungen .\n",
      "Das war dann aber recht schnell vergessen , als die Kommission das neue Instrument dafür , die Leitlinien , entwickelt hatte und mehr Verbindlichkeit in die Forderung nach Effizienz , Konzentration und Verwaltungsvereinfachung beim Einsatz der Europäischen Strukturfonds bringen wollte .\n",
      "Dann beriefen sich die Regierungen in den Mitgliedstaaten auf das Subsidiaritätsprinzip und wollten das Geld nur einfach rübergeschoben haben .\n",
      "Vom Berliner Gipfel 1999 blieb dann nur noch der indikative Charakter der Leitlinien übrig .\n",
      "Dieser verpflichtet jedoch die Kommission zumindest dazu , nur die Programme zu genehmigen , mit denen die europäischen Ziele auch wirklich erreicht werden können .\n",
      "Wenn ich auch Zweifel habe , daß dieses indikative Instrument wirklich ausreicht , um Effizienz und Konzentration zu erreichen und die europäischen Ziele wirklich umzusetzen , so ist doch Fakt , daß die Leitlinien in den Verhandlungen für das gemeinschaftliche Förderkonzept eine zentrale Rolle spielen werden .\n",
      "Wenn die europäische Ebene ernst genommen werden will , müssen sie das auch !\n",
      "Der Parlament hatte nicht die Möglichkeit , inhaltlich auf die Leitlinien einzugehen , weil es erst konsultiert wurde , als die Legislaturperiode längst vorbei war .\n",
      "Jetzt , wo die Programmierungsphasen weit vorangeschritten sind , macht es wenig Sinn , alles zurückzuholen .\n",
      "Deshalb konzentriere ich mich in meinem Bericht in Abstimmung mit dem Ausschuß auf den strategischen Charakter des Instrumentes .\n",
      "Erstens : Der Bericht prüft die Wirkung des Instrumentes an sich .\n",
      "Zweitens : Er deckt die Mängel im Kommissionsdokument auf .\n",
      "So wurde beispielsweise im zentralen Teil der Strukturfonds die Partnerschaft schlichtweg vergessen .\n",
      "Das zentrale Prinzip , welches die Mitgliedstaaten auffordert , daß Programme mit den Kommunen und Regionen , aber auch mit den lokalen Akteuren , Wirtschafts- und Sozialverbänden , NGO , Gewerkschaften , Unternehmerverbänden , Frauenverbänden , Bürgerinitiativen , Beschäftigungsinitiativen vor Ort erarbeitet werden , sucht man im Dokument vergeblich .\n",
      "Die Frage , warum es vergessen wurde , ist bis heute nicht beantwortet worden .\n",
      "Hier stellt das Parlament zentrale Forderungen .\n",
      "Es erwartet von der Kommission , daß sie nur die Programme genehmigt , die in einer solchen Partnerschaft entstanden sind .\n",
      "Es wundert mich schon , liebe KollegInnen von der Konservativen Fraktion , daß ich so plötzlich über Nacht Änderungsanträge vorfinde , die den dezentralen Ansatz streichen wollen .\n",
      "Ich kann nur sagen , gehen Sie damit in Ihre Regionen und erklären Sie Ihren Wählerinnen und Wählern , warum in den Regionen nicht das europäische Prinzip der Dezentralität verwirklicht werden soll .\n",
      "Ich kann Ihnen sagen , Sie werden nicht ganz ungeschoren davonkommen .\n",
      "Es kann nicht sein , daß wir hier Prinzipien vereinbaren , und wenn es um die Umsetzung geht , macht wieder jeder was er will .\n",
      "Dazu gleich noch eine Nebenbemerkung an die Regierung meines Landes , in dem man die horizontale Gemeinschaftspolitik betreffend Umweltschutz einfach ignorieren will und meinte , die FFH-Linie nicht umsetzen zu müssen .\n",
      "Ich finde es gut , daß die Kommission hier streng bleibt .\n",
      "Damit knüpfe ich an den letzten Punkt an .\n",
      "Die Leitlinien müssen konkreter Gradmesser dafür sein , ob der Artikel 1 der Verordnung wirklich umgesetzt wird .\n",
      "Ich erwarte von der Kommission , daß die Leitlinien , die ja wirklich genügend Flexibilität darstellen , wirklich der Maßstab für die Verhandlungen sind .\n",
      "Wir vertreten die europäische Position .\n",
      "Das heißt , Nachhaltigkeit in der Verkehrspolitik muß genauso berücksichtigt sein wie der Frauenanteil in der Förderung sowie die Tatsache , daß jedes Programm auch den Globalzuschuß vorsieht und dadurch möglich wird , daß es eine nachhaltige Städteentwicklung und auch wirklich Modellprojekte im ländlichen Raum gibt .\n",
      "Ich erwarte , daß das die Ergebnisse der gemeinschaftlichen Förderkonzepte sind und daß Sie hier nicht wieder einknicken .\n",
      "Denn wie wollen wir sonst erreichen , daß die Arbeitslosenrate sinkt , wenn wir wieder warten , wenn wir wieder versuchen , uns dahin zu mogeln ?\n",
      "Wir können nicht warten !\n",
      "Es sind die letzten Jahre , in denen wir die europäische Strukturpolitik in diesem hohen Finanzmaße umsetzen können .\n",
      "Danach kommen viele Länder dazu , und dann müssen wir sowieso viel bessere , effizientere und konzentriertere Strukturen schaffen .\n",
      "Und das ist erst der Anfang .\n",
      "Deswegen erwarte ich von der Kommission , daß sie in den Verhandlungen die Forderungen des Parlaments ernst nimmt und daß sie hier die europäische Position wirklich umsetzt und so einer fortschrittlichen Regionalpolitik endlich eine Chance gibt .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , ich freue mich ganz besonders , daß mein erster Beitrag im Europäischen Parlament einem Thema gewidmet ist , das in dem Teil des Vereinigten Königreichs , den ich in diesem Parlament vertrete , nämlich Wales , als das wichtigste Thema überhaupt gilt .\n",
      "Wie Sie wissen , wurde einem beträchtlichen Teil von Wales gemäß Strukturfondsprogramm der Status einer Ziel-1-Region zuerkannt .\n",
      "Und so erwarten auch viele Menschen in Wales , daß die Europäischen Strukturfonds ihnen bei der Überwindung einiger der gewaltigen Schwierigkeiten , mit denen wir ohne Zweifel zu kämpfen haben , hilft .\n",
      "Die Armut in Wales nimmt weiter zu , wobei sie seit 1997 besonders stark ansteigt .\n",
      "Die Kluft zwischen Arm und Reich wird immer tiefer .\n",
      "Wir erhoffen uns daher vom Strukturfondsprogramm nicht nur eine wirtschaftliche Umstrukturierung , sondern eine weitreichendere Verbesserung der wirtschaftlichen Basis des Landesteils .\n",
      "Was uns jedoch schwer zu schaffen macht , ist die Tatsache , daß die Gewährung von Unterstützung im Rahmen der Strukturfonds in gewisser Weise als Erfolg der Regierung verbucht wird .\n",
      "Dabei ist es doch nur ein weiterer Ausdruck für die immensen Schwierigkeiten , vor denen Wales steht .\n",
      "Deshalb möchte ich auf einige Probleme aufmerksam machen , denen sich die Kommission vorrangig widmen sollte .\n",
      "Wir erwarten von der Kommission , daß sie Problemen im Zusammenhang mit der Zusätzlichkeit mehr Aufmerksamkeit widmet .\n",
      "Wir halten es für falsch , daß die entsprechenden Zahlen in gewisser Weise in den Zahlen für das Vereinigte Königreich untergegangen sind .\n",
      "Wir erwarten von der Kommission , daß es einen ergänzenden Finanzierungsanteil für die Vorhaben gibt .\n",
      "Wir erwarten , daß sie die britische Regierung drängt sicherzustellen , daß der private Sektor , der zweifellos die treibende Kraft im Hinblick auf die Bereitstellung von Mitteln im Rahmen der Strukturfonds darstellen muß , in die Planung einbezogen wird .\n",
      "Schließlich bitten wir die Kommission , für mehr Transparenz bei der Ausgabe von Strukturfondsgeldern zu sorgen .\n",
      "Zu vielem , was in diesem Parlament passiert , mangelt es an Transparenz .\n",
      "Dies ist ein Bereich , in dem sich die Kommission , wie ich meine , als wahrer Freund von Wales erweisen kann .\n",
      "Herr Präsident !\n",
      "Unser Ausschuß erörtert die vorliegenden Fragen aus vielen unterschiedlichen Blickwinkeln .\n",
      "Zunächst möchte ich mich zum Forschungsaspekt äußern .\n",
      "Wir erachten es als sehr positiv , daß die Berichterstatterin den Vorschlag unseres Ausschusses in ihre Schlußfolgerungen aufgenommen hat , wonach in den Kohäsionsländern die wissenschaftliche Infrastruktur ausgedehnt werden muß , indem Hochschulen und Bildungseinrichtungen an solchen Orten geschaffen werden , an denen sie besser als bisher den Bewohnern unterentwickelter Regionen zur Verfügung stehen , und es Absolventen erleichtert wird , in ihren Heimatregionen zu verbleiben .\n",
      "Das wird durch staatliche Maßnahmen ermöglicht , und eine solche Dezentralisation der höheren Ausbildung ist nachgerade eine sinnvolle Politik für eine ausgeglichene Entwicklung .\n",
      "In einer anderen Frage , auf die wir besonders unter dem Blickwinkel der Industriepolitik aufmerksam machen möchten , hätten wir uns gewünscht , daß die Kommission bei der Planung der Koordinierung von Kohäsionsfonds und Strukturfonds die Auswirkungen des Wachstums des Dienstleistungssektors , des elektronischen Handels und der Nutzung des Internets mehr berücksichtigt hätte .\n",
      "Armut und Reichtum hingen früher mehr von der Wirtschaftsstruktur ab .\n",
      "Reich waren jene Regionen , in denen es Arbeitsplätze in der Industrie gab .\n",
      "Jetzt sind aus diesen Regionen teilweise Problemfälle und arme Gebiete geworden , wo auch in neue Branchen wie Elektronik und Dienstleistungen investiert werden muß , weil diese als zukunftsweisende Bereiche gelten .\n",
      "Diese Tatsache hat der federführende Ausschuß meines Erachtens in seinem Bericht nicht ausreichend berücksichtigt , so daß ich die Kommission im Namen des Industrieausschusses darauf hinweisen möchte .\n",
      "Als Ausschuß für Energie hätten wir uns schließlich noch gewünscht , daß die Förderung der erneuerbaren Energien aus den Mitteln des Kohäsions- und Strukturfonds eine noch größere Rolle gespielt hätte .\n",
      "Auf diese Weise hätte mittels Koordinierung die Nutzung dieser erneuerbaren Energieformen so entwickelt werden können , daß unzureichende Finanzmittel des Energieprogramms durch diese umfangreicheren Mittel kompensiert werden .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , ich möchte Frau Schroedter ganz herzlich für die von ihr zu diesem Thema geleistete Arbeit danken .\n",
      "Gleichzeitig möchte ich erklären , daß ich im Namen meiner Kollegin Frau Flautre spreche , die die Stellungnahme im Auftrag des Ausschusses für Beschäftigung und soziale Angelegenheiten erarbeitet hat und leider erkrankt ist .\n",
      "Ich möchte Ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf die Änderungsanträge 1 und 2 lenken , die vom Ausschuß für Beschäftigung und soziale Angelegenheiten vorgelegt , jedoch vom Ausschuß für Regionalpolitik , Verkehr und Fremdenverkehr abgelehnt wurden .\n",
      "Darin geht es um die Sozialwirtschaft und die Notwendigkeit der Bereitstellung von \" social risk capital \" und der finanziellen Unterstützung von lokalen Programmen zur Schaffung von Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten und zur Stärkung des sozialen Zusammenhalts .\n",
      "Das Parlament sah in der Sozialwirtschaft stets einen wichtigen potentiellen Anbieter von Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten .\n",
      "Die genannten Änderungsanträge decken sich mit der vom Parlament vertretenen Ansicht , daß die soziale Ausgrenzung ein ernstes Problem darstellt , das konstruktive Maßnahmen erfordert .\n",
      "Wir hoffen , daß diejenigen , die eine Ablehnung dieser Änderungsanträge in Betracht ziehen , sowohl dem Parlament als auch ihren Arbeit suchenden Bürgern triftige Gründe für ihre Entscheidung nennen können .\n",
      "Frau Flautre verwies in ihrem Bericht auch auf einen Bereich , dem es stark an Koordinierung mangelt , wenngleich gerade hier beträchtlicher Koordinierungsbedarf besteht .\n",
      "Die Vorschläge der Kommission beziehen sich auf die vier Pfeiler der Beschäftigungsstrategie und die fünf Aktionsbereiche des Europäischen Sozialfonds .\n",
      "Doch das Fehlen konkreter Leitlinien ist um so bedauerlicher , als die Idee , die ESF-Interventionen mit der Beschäftigungsstrategie zu verknüpfen , im Planungszeitraum 2000-2006 erstmals umgesetzt wird .\n",
      "Dieses Versäumnis weckt jedenfalls den Eindruck , daß auch die Kommission nicht weiß , wie eine möglichst umfassende Koordinierung zwischen den ESF-Interventionen , die nach dreieinhalb Jahren einer Prüfung unterliegen , und den jährlichen Nationalen Aktionsplänen für die Beschäftigung der Mitgliedstaaten zu bewerkstelligen ist .\n",
      "Wir hoffen , daß uns die Kommission davon überzeugen kann , daß es sich dabei lediglich um ein Versehen handelt , das umgehend korrigiert wird .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar , meine Damen und Herren !\n",
      "Der von der Kommission in Erfüllung ihres Mandats unterbreitete Vorschlag ist für den Ausschuß für Landwirtschaft und ländliche Entwicklung ein vernünftiger Ausgangspunkt .\n",
      "Ich möchte allerdings an dieser Stelle hervorheben , daß uns dieser Ausgangspunkt die vor uns stehenden Herausforderungen aufzeigt : angesichts der Veränderungen in den wirtschaftlichen Tätigkeiten aller Art infolge der schwindenden Bedeutung des Landwirtschaftssektors innerhalb der verschiedenen Einkommensquellen der ländlichen Gesellschaft die Bevölkerung im ländlichen Raum zu halten .\n",
      "Zusammen mit den Unzulänglichkeiten in der Infrastruktur und im Dienstleistungsbereich und einem allgemein sehr spärlichen , stark saisonabhängigen und wenig diversifizierten Beschäftigungsangebot verstärken sie die Abwanderung aus den ländlichen Gebieten .\n",
      "Die Folgen lassen nicht auf sich warten .\n",
      "Es sind die jungen Menschen , die abwandern , diejenigen , die Ausbildung und Beschäftigung außerhalb der ländlichen Gebiete finden , was sich in diesen Regionen sehr ungünstig auswirkt .\n",
      "Diese fehlende Infrastruktur ist wiederum ein Hindernis für die Ansiedlung von Unternehmen und die Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen .\n",
      "Man muß sich vor Augen halten , daß der ländliche Raum nahezu vier Fünftel des Territoriums der Europäischen Union ausmacht .\n",
      "Die Landwirtschaft stellt nur 5,5 % der Arbeitsplätze der Union .\n",
      "Darüber hinaus sind drei Viertel unserer Landwirte Nebenerwerbslandwirte und auf zusätzliche Einkommensquellen angewiesen .\n",
      "Aus diesem Grund ist es eines der wichtigsten und weitreichendsten Ziele , die wir uns in der Europäischen Union stellen sollten , Anstrengungen zur Schaffung neuer Arbeitsplätze in den ländlichen Gebieten außerhalb des Agrarsektors zu unternehmen , unter anderem in den Bereichen ländlicher Tourismus , Sport , Kultur , Sanierung der Ressourcen , Umstellung von Unternehmen , neue Technologien , Dienstleistungen usw. Doch obwohl die Landwirtschaft keine ausschließliche Rolle mehr spielt , ist sie weiterhin wichtig , nicht nur , um den wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Niedergang der ländlichen Gebiete und das Entstehen von weiteren Geisterstädten zu verhindern , sondern auch , weil den Landwirten eine grundlegende Rolle bei der Bewirtschaftung des Territoriums , dem Erhalt der Artenvielfalt und dem Umweltschutz zukommt .\n",
      "Deshalb treten wir für eine Landwirtschaftspolitik und eine ländliche Entwicklung ein , die mit unseren Zielen im Einklang steht , sowie dafür , daß die ländlichen Gebiete an der Schwelle zum 21. Jahrhundert wettbewerbsfähig und multifunktional sein müssen , sowohl in bezug auf den landwirtschaftlichen Aspekt als auch hinsichtlich der Öffnung für die Vielfalt nicht landwirtschaftlicher Tätigkeiten .\n",
      "Es ist wichtig , allgemeinen Kriterien der Raumordnung und der ausgewogenen Bevölkerungsstruktur vorrangige Beachtung zu schenken und die Schlußfolgerungen zu berücksichtigen , zu denen der Ausschuß für Landwirtschaft und ländliche Entwicklung in fünf Hauptaspekten gelangt ist , die nur teilweise vom Ausschuß für Regionalpolitik , Verkehr und Fremdenverkehr in seinen Punkten 16 und 17 aufgegriffen worden sind .\n",
      "Abschließend möchte ich die Kommission ersuchen , diese fünf Punkte bei der Formulierung der Schlußfolgerungen der vier Pfeiler zu berücksichtigen , denn nach meiner Auffassung muß die Bindung der Bevölkerung an den ländlichen Raum eines der vorrangigen Ziele der Europäischen Union bilden .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar , liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen !\n",
      "Ich möchte meinen Redebeitrag mit einem Dank an Frau Schroedter , der Berichterstatterin , für die geleistete Arbeit einleiten .\n",
      "Ich meine , es ist eine sehr gute Arbeit .\n",
      "Außerdem möchte ich ihr für ihre Bereitschaft zum Dialog mit den übrigen Fraktionen bei der Suche nach Kompromißformeln angesichts dieser Lawine von Änderungsanträgen danken ; es waren vielleicht mehr als erwartet , aber sie tragen eigentlich der Bedeutung des hier behandelten Berichts Rechnung .\n",
      "Für uns ist es wichtig , daß die in diesem Parlament gebilligten Schlußfolgerungen von der Kommission , zumindest ihrem Wesen nach , berücksichtigt werden , denn bei dem nunmehr erreichten Stand könnte es so aussehen , als gäben wir uns hier einer unnütze , rein rhetorischen Tätigkeit hin .\n",
      "Wir sind indes der Ansicht und das spiegelt sich auch wörtlich in den Schlußfolgerungen wider , daß die Kommission die Beschlüsse dieses Parlaments in Betracht ziehen muß , vor allem im Hinblick auf die Halbzeitbewertung dieser Leitlinien .\n",
      "In unseren Änderungsanträgen haben wir festgeschrieben , welche Bedeutung wir der Herausbildung der notwendigen Synergien zwischen den Strukturfonds , dem Kohäsionsfonds und den Gemeinschaftsinitiativen beimessen , so daß ihre Anwendung auf optimale und rentabelste Weise im zunehmenden Abbau der regionalen Ungleichheiten und in der Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen ihren Niederschlag findet , die letztendlich die beiden Hauptziele der hier zur Debatte stehenden Fonds sind .\n",
      "Um der Erreichung dieser Ziele einen schnellen und wirksamen Impuls zu verleihen , halten wir es für notwendig , daß die Unternehmer , das heißt diejenigen , die Arbeitsplätze schaffen , die wirklichen Unternehmergeist zeigen und tatsächlich neue Beschäftigungsquellen garantieren , in diese Initiative eingebunden werden .\n",
      "Vor allem die kleinen und mittleren Unternehmer müssen in die Verteilung dieser Fonds einbezogen werden .\n",
      "Wenn sich die Unternehmer dagegen an den Rand gedrängt fühlen , wenn sie nicht mitwirken können ich sage jetzt , nicht nur an der Verwaltung , sondern an der Entgegennahme dieser Fonds , werden wir eine Chance zur schnelleren Erreichung unserer Ziele verloren haben .\n",
      "Gleichfalls wichtig für das Erreichen unserer Ziele , für die Überwindung der regionalen Ungleichheiten und für die Erschließung von Arbeitsplätzen ist der entschlossene Einsatz für die neuen Technologien , für die Verkehrs- und Kommunikationsnetze und für die erneuerbaren Energien .\n",
      "Und dies alles - wohlgemerkt unter Mitwirkung der Privatwirtschaft , die ihre Anstrengungen mit denen der öffentlichen Verwaltungen vereint , damit sie sich ergänzen und sich zu keinem Zeitpunkt behindern oder ausschließen schafft gesellschaftlichen Reichtum und Arbeitsplätze .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , ich halte es für meine Pflicht , meinen Kollegen Herrn Evans daran zu erinnern , weshalb Wales überhaupt zu einer Ziel-1-Region erklärt wurde .\n",
      "Das ist das Ergebnis der fragwürdigen Politik seiner Partei , der Konservativen .\n",
      "Vielleicht darf ich ihn auch daran erinnern , daß der Vorsitzende seiner Partei , Herr Hague , als er noch Minister für Wales war , sämtliche Regeln in bezug auf die Zusätzlichkeit verletzt hat , die man nur verletzen kann , und dafür von Kommissionsmitglied Wulf-Mathies schriftlich entschieden zur Ordnung gerufen wurde .\n",
      "Ich kann Ihnen versichern , daß der britischen Regierung sehr wohl bekannt ist , daß für die Ziel-1-Regionen der Grundsatz der Zusätzlichkeit gilt .\n",
      "Ich schlage vor , daß sich Herr Evans nochmals mit der entsprechenden Verordnung vertraut macht .\n",
      "Meine Fraktion hat umfangreiche Änderungsvorschläge für beide heute zur Debatte stehenden Berichte erarbeitet .\n",
      "Ich meine , wir sollten uns auf die zentrale Rolle der Leitlinien konzentrieren .\n",
      "Es geht darum , einen Rahmen und ein Instrumentarium zu schaffen , um die wirtschaftliche Erneuerung zu unterstützen und zu fördern , um die Ressourcen möglichst effektiv und unter Einbeziehung möglichst vieler Partner zu nutzen und den betreffenden Regionen den Weg zum wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung und zur nachhaltigen Entwicklung zu ebnen , so daß diese schließlich vom Finanztropf genommen werden können .\n",
      "Wir müssen herausfinden , über welche Qualifikationen und Potentiale unsere Regionen im High-Tech-Sektor verfügen .\n",
      "Das ist angesichts von Medienberichten , denen zufolge Europa bei den zukunftsträchtigen High-Tech-Wachstumsbranchen gegenüber den USA immer mehr an Boden verliert , ganz besonders wichtig .\n",
      "Die Durchführung der letzten Programmrunde ist auch insofern sehr lehrreich , als daß sie verdeutlicht , worum es bei den Leitlinien nicht gehen sollte .\n",
      "Es sollte nicht darum gehen , neue bürokratische Hindernisse zu errichten .\n",
      "Es sollte nicht darum gehen , auf halbem Wege Änderungen an den Prioritäten und Politiken vorzunehmen , was zwangsläufig Verzögerungen und Nichtausschöpfung der Mittel zur Folge hat .\n",
      "Dies ist gerade im Hinblick auf die neuen Anforderungen an die Haushaltsdisziplin von Bedeutung .\n",
      "Die Umsetzung und Anwendung der Leitlinien kann nicht der persönlichen Auslegung durch diesen oder jenen Bediensteten in der Kommission oder im Staatsdienst überlassen werden .\n",
      "Innerhalb der zuständigen Direktion der Kommission ist für Einheitlichkeit zu sorgen , während gleichzeitig die spezifischen lokalen und regionalen Aspekte der Kommissionsprogramme zu berücksichtigen sind .\n",
      "Daraus läßt sich ableiten , daß wir breite , indikative und flexible Leitlinien anstreben müssen , auf die sich sowohl unsere Programm-Manager als auch die Begünstigten stützen können und die zu einer maximalen Erschließung des Potentials der neuen Bereiche der wirtschaftlichen Erneuerung beitragen .\n",
      "Wenn es uns gelingt , das unternehmerische Tun in unseren armen und strukturschwachen Regionen anzukurbeln , werden wir schließlich das Steuer herumreißen und das Vertrauen von Investoren maßgeblich festigen können .\n",
      "Damit steht einer erfolgreichen Entwicklung nichts mehr im Wege .\n",
      "Der Erfolg dieser Leitlinien wird daran zu messen sein , ob es der EU-Regionalpolitik , gestützt auf gute , solide und umsetzbare Leitlinien , gelingt , neue Möglichkeiten zu erschließen und dafür zu sogen , daß unsere armen und strukturschwachen Regionen einen umfassenden Beitrag zu Wachstum und Wohlstand in der EU leisten können .\n",
      "Herr Präsident !\n",
      "Herr Kommissar !\n",
      "Sehr geehrte Kollegen !\n",
      "Ich danke Frau Schroedter für den fundierten Bericht .\n",
      "Sie hat sich eingehend mit der Problematik beschäftigt und während der Behandlung im Ausschuß viele zu dem vorliegenden Bericht eingegangene Änderungsanträge berücksichtigt .\n",
      "Zu Recht stellt die Berichterstatterin zudem fest , daß das Parlament nicht rechtzeitig zu den Leitlinien gehört wurde .\n",
      "Jetzt sind wir dadurch sehr in Verzug geraten .\n",
      "Es bleibt zu hoffen , daß die Stellungnahmen des Parlaments bei der Halbzeitbewertung und für die praktische Umsetzung dennoch von Nutzen sind .\n",
      "Was den Zeitpunkt betrifft , so ist hier der Bericht während der Behandlung zu umfangreich geraten , wobei Detailfragen und Aspekte aufgenommen wurden , die schon in früheren Berichten enthalten waren .\n",
      "In dieser Phase müssen wir uns darauf konzentrieren , wie mit diesem Prozeß die Regionalpolitik der Union gelenkt werden kann , und zwar im Hinblick auf die Zielsetzung , die regionalen Unterschiede abzubauen .\n",
      "Unsere Fraktion unterstreicht das Subsidiaritätsprinzip , die Verantwortung der Mitgliedstaaten und die Rolle der regionalen Partner bei der Erarbeitung und Umsetzung der Programme .\n",
      "Für äußerst wichtig erachten wir , die kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen in die Planung und Durchführung der Programme einzubeziehen .\n",
      "Ferner befürwortet unsere Fraktion eine stärkere Berücksichtigung der überseeischen Regionen und anderen Gebieten in Randlage und möchte die Wechselwirkungen zwischen Stadt und Land entwickeln .\n",
      "Wir sind gegen eine übertriebene Bevormundung durch die Union und die Zentralverwaltungen der Mitgliedstaaten und fordern den Abbau der Bürokratie bei der Erarbeitung und Realisierung der Programme .\n",
      "Der Erfolg von Projekten , die mit Hilfe der Union umgesetzt werden , wird häufig durch langsame Entscheidungsfindung und komplizierte Verwaltungsverfahren beeinträchtigt .\n",
      "Bei der Vorbereitung des Berichts gab es eine anregende Debatte über die Regionalpolitik der Union im allgemeinen .\n",
      "Das war für uns neue Mitglieder das erste Mal , und ich sehe darin einen äußerst interessanten Prozeß .\n",
      "Unsere Fraktion hält diesen Bericht für sehr gut und befürwortet ihn .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar , sehr geehrte Kollegen !\n",
      "Als Beweis dafür , daß dieses Parlament die Phase einer beratenden und untergeordneten Institution noch nicht überwunden hat , konnte der ausgezeichnete Bericht meiner Fraktionskollegin Elisabeth Schroedter nicht ins Plenum gelangen , weil die Regionalentwicklungspläne des Zeitraums 2000-2006 für die Ziel-1-Regionen bereits mehrere Monate in den Arbeitszimmern der Kommission liegen .\n",
      "Angesichts dessen müssen wir in diesem Parlament auf jeden Fall verlangen , daß die gemeinschaftlichen Förderkonzepte für den fraglichen Zeitraum in diesem Parlament vor ihrer Annahme geprüft und erörtert werden , und zwar anhand der Leitlinien , die wir heute vorlegen , denn wir halten sie für ganz besonders geeignet , Arbeitsplätze in den ärmsten oder am wenigsten entwickelten Regionen zu schaffen , und so tragen wir dazu bei , den negativen , zur Ungleichheit führenden Tendenzen in der europäischen Gesellschaft entgegenzuwirken , damit wir zu einem gerechteren Europa kommen .\n",
      "Herr Präsident !\n",
      "Wir sollten nicht vergessen , daß das wichtigste strategische Ziel der Struktur- und Kohäsionsfonds und ihrer Koordinierung in der Erreichung des wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Zusammenhalts liegt .\n",
      "Es ist unsere Pflicht , an der Erarbeitung der Leitlinien und auch an der Evaluierung der Ergebnisse mitzuwirken .\n",
      "Denn wir sind die Vertreter der Bürger im Europa der Bürger und nicht nur in einem Europa der Staaten und der Regionen .\n",
      "Wir konstatieren , daß die Fonds eine notwendige , aber nicht ausreichende Voraussetzung für den wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Zusammenhalt sind .\n",
      "Wenn wir als einzigen Indikator das Bruttoinlandsprodukt pro Einwohner nehmen , können wir fehlgehen .\n",
      "Einige Kollegen haben bereits über die Arbeitslosigkeit und den Bevölkerungsrückgang gesprochen .\n",
      "Es müssen eine Reihe von Indikatoren untersucht werden , die es uns ermöglichen , den Stand und die Entwicklung regionaler Gesellschaften zu erkennen , die sich in einer ungünstigeren Situation als andere befinden .\n",
      "Aus einigen heute dem Plenum des Parlaments vorgelegten Berichten geht klar hervor , daß die Arbeitslosigkeit in den 25 am stärksten entwickelten europäischen Regionen nur ein Fünftel der Arbeitslosigkeit in den 25 am schwächsten entwickelten Regionen ausmacht .\n",
      "Dies zwingt das Europäische Parlament , den Herrn Kommissar und die Kommission zu entschlossenem strategischen Handeln .\n",
      "Ich gebe auch zu , daß das Europäische Parlament keine Gelegenheit hatte - oder nicht erhalten hat , da die Wahlperiode zu Ende ging - , um über die Leitlinien zu sprechen .\n",
      "Aber ich glaube nicht , daß der Bericht zu spät kommt .\n",
      "Wir brauchen eine gemeinsame Reflexion , damit die neuen Ziel-1-Programme und die regionalen Entwicklungspläne , die vor dem Wirksamwerden der Leitlinien erarbeitet worden sind , einer Revision und wirklichen Bewertung unterzogen werden können .\n",
      "Es ist notwendig , die Programme der unterschiedlichen Ziele zu koordinieren .\n",
      "Wir alle sind uns einig in der Forderung , daß dem Parlament nach der Hälfte der Durchführungszeit dieser Programme , wenn die Bewertung der Leitlinien vorgenommen wird , eine Hauptrolle zukommt , denn wir sind die Vertreter der Bürger .\n",
      "Die Bürger können nicht akzeptieren , daß die Europäische Union Beschlüsse in einer , zumindest scheinbar , bürokratischen Form faßt .\n",
      "Es ist für sie erforderlich , daß die politische Dimension funktioniert , daß Verantwortlichkeiten bestehen , daß eine Kommunikation mit den Bürgern vorhanden ist .\n",
      "Das fordern wir heute vom Herrn Kommissar .\n",
      "Ich denke , er wird , ausgehend von seiner früheren Erfahrung als Präsident einer Region , zustimmen , daß Indikatoren und eine Strategie für den wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Zusammenhalt und nicht nur für die Produktivität vorgeschlagen werden .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , ich unterstütze die wichtigsten Vorschläge des Berichts im Hinblick auf die Verwaltung der Strukturfonds und des Kohäsionsfonds für den Zeitraum 2000-2006 sowie die wichtigsten in dem Bericht enthaltenen Empfehlungen .\n",
      "Dazu zählt u. a. , daß jederzeit ein einheitlicher Ansatz für die Verwendung der Mittel der EU-Strukturfonds und des Kohäsionsfonds bestehen muß .\n",
      "Das bedeutet , daß lokale Gebietskörperschaften und nationale Regierungen bei der Verwendung dieser Mittel eng und partnerschaftlich zusammenarbeiten müssen .\n",
      "Die Mitgliedstaaten werden aufgefordert , integrierten Strategien zur Wiederbelebung der Beziehungen zwischen städtischen und ländlichen Räumen mehr Bedeutung beizumessen , wobei es auf den ländlichen Raum besonders ankommt .\n",
      "Auch wenn die Erneuerung unserer Städte sehr wichtig ist , müssen wir in unserer Politik stets auf ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis zwischen der Förderung der ländlichen Entwicklung und der Verbesserung der Lebensbedingungen der Stadtbewohner achten .\n",
      "Es kann uns nicht darum gehen , allein ein Europa der Städte zu errichten .\n",
      "Die Strukturfonds haben vor allem durch die Modernisierung der Straßen , der Wasseraufbereitung und der jeweiligen Verkehrsnetze maßgeblich zur Entwicklung der ländlichen wie auch städtischen Räume in den EU-Ländern in Randlage beigetragen .\n",
      "Dieser Prozeß wird im Einklang mit den von den Staats- und Regierungschefs der EU auf ihrem Gipfeltreffen in Berlin im vergangenen Jahr festgelegten Ausgabenleitlinien , denen das Parlament auf seiner Maitagung zugestimmt hat , fortgesetzt .\n",
      "Die wichtigsten von der EU von 1989 bis 1993 und von 1994 bis 1999 durchgeführten Programme konnten ganz wesentlich zur Verbesserung der wirtschaftlichen Wettbewerbsfähigkeit von Randregionen und Ziel-1-Regionen in Europa beitragen .\n",
      "Jetzt geht es darum , das bisher Erreichte zu festigen und auf Dauer zu erhalten .\n",
      "Dadurch hätten die Länder in Randlage und die Regionen in äußerster Randlage , also die ärmeren Regionen in Europa , die Möglichkeit , erfolgreich im neuen Euro-Währungsgebiet wie auch auf einem weiter expandierenden und von einem freien Waren- , Personen- , Dienstleistungs- und Kapitalverkehr gekennzeichneten Binnenmarkt zu operieren .\n",
      "Zwar sind wichtige Infrastrukturprojekte aus dem Europäischen Fonds für regionale Entwicklung und dem Kohäsionsfonds gefördert worden , doch sollten wir nicht vergessen , daß der Europäische Sozialfonds einen ganz bedeutenden Beitrag zur Unterstützung der weniger wohlhabenden Bürger unserer Gesellschaft geleistet hat .\n",
      "So hat er zur Verbesserung der Einrichtungen der Tertiärstufe , zur Finanzierung von dem Schulabschluß nachgeschalteten Ausbildungsmaßnahmen und zur Schaffung umfassender Programme beigetragen , die der Bekämpfung der Jugend- und Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit , der Unterstützung von Jugendlichen , die vorzeitig die Schule verlassen , und der Bekämpfung des Analphabetentums bei Erwachsenen dienen .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , bislang war ich in bezug auf regionalpolitische Ansätze oft anderer Meinung als die Berichterstatterin , diesmal jedoch stimme ich mit ihr überein .\n",
      "Vielleicht wird sie dadurch ermutigt , in diese Richtung weiterzuarbeiten , auf jeden Fall möchte ich ihr aber meine Glückwünsche aussprechen .\n",
      "Zweitens : Wir hätten es lieber gesehen , wenn die Leitlinien der Verordnung als Anhang beigefügt worden wären , wie wir es von Frau McCarthy als Berichterstatterin für die allgemeine Verordnung gefordert hatten .\n",
      "Das ist leider nicht geschehen , was allerdings nicht Herrn Bernie , sondern der alten Kommission anzulasten ist .\n",
      "Ich komme nur darauf zu sprechen , weil ich noch einmal die Position des Parlaments verdeutlichen wollte .\n",
      "Drittens möchte ich anmerken , daß wir mit den Leitlinien im großen und ganzen einverstanden sind , soweit sie nicht von unseren Bemerkungen abweichen .\n",
      "Sie stellen ein wesentliches Hilfsmittel für die Mitgliedstaaten dar .\n",
      "Besonders hervorheben möchte ich , daß die Kommission der nachhaltigen Entwicklung , der Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der Chancengleichheit und der Verkehrsproblematik einen hohen Stellenwert einräumt .\n",
      "Dem kann ich zumindest persönlich uneingeschränkt zustimmen .\n",
      "Als Inselbewohner möchte ich jedoch kritisch anmerken , daß die Entwicklung der Inseln in ihrer Bedeutung verkannt wird .\n",
      "Diesem Punkt wird - wieder einmal - nicht die nötige Aufmerksamkeit gewidmet : Das geht nun schon all die fünf Jahre so , die ich Mitglied des Parlaments bin , und immer wieder habe ich auf das Problem hingewiesen .\n",
      "Wir werden auch künftig keine Ruhe geben , denn in Artikel 158 Absatz 1 des Vertrages von Amsterdam ist von einer umfassenden Politik für die Inseln die Rede .\n",
      "Die Kommission muß sich also endlich mit dieser Frage befassen .\n",
      "Im übrigen wird es nun wirklich langsam Zeit , die Programme umzusetzen , und insofern müssen auch die Mitgliedstaaten ihrer Verantwortung nachkommen und ihre Hausaufgaben machen .\n",
      "Was uns hier im Parlament betrifft , so möchte ich auf den im Mai verabschiedeten und für Parlament und Kommission geltenden Verhaltenskodex verweisen .\n",
      "Ich bin fest davon überzeugt , daß dieser Kodex eingehalten und das Parlament über alle Entwicklungen und Details in bezug auf die Umsetzung der Programme auf dem laufenden gehalten wird .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar , meine lieben Kolleginnen und Kollegen , in meinen anderthalb Minuten Redezeit möchte ich zunächst unsere Kollegin Frau Schroedter beglückwünschen .\n",
      "Viele haben das zwar schon getan , doch ich denke , sie hat es wirklich verdient , denn sie hat sich Anregungen der einen und anderen Seite gegenüber sehr offen und aufgeschlossen gezeigt , und ich meine , daß sich dies in der Qualität ihres Berichts niedergeschlagen hat .\n",
      "Wie die Berichterstatterin bedaure ich , daß das Parlament in bezug auf die Leitlinien quasi auf den fahrenden Zug aufgesprungen ist , da die Verhandlungen mit den Staaten bereits so weit fortgeschritten sind , daß man nicht davon ausgehen kann , daß dieser Bericht noch unmittelbare Auswirkungen haben wird .\n",
      "Deshalb halte ich es für notwendig , daß das Parlament vorausdenkt und die Leitlinien für die Revision nach der Hälfte der Laufzeit im Jahr 2003 festlegt und noch versuchen sollte , die zweite Programmphase ab 2003 zu beeinflussen .\n",
      "Ich meine damit , daß wir uns am Anfang des Planungszeitraums 2000-2006 befinden , der angesichts von zwei großen Herausforderungen keineswegs als Routineangelegenheit aufgefaßt werden darf .\n",
      "Die erste Herausforderung ist die Harmonisierung der nationalen Raumordnungs- und der regionalen Entwicklungspolitiken .\n",
      "Subventionen reichen für eine Entwicklung nicht aus , wenn Infrastrukturen oder öffentliche Dienstleistungen fehlen .\n",
      "Wir stehen also vor der grundsätzlichen Frage , wie wir eine Verzahnung der Politik der Union mit den nationalen subsidiären Raumordnungspolitiken erreichen können .\n",
      "Die zweite Herausforderung ist die Erweiterung , die natürlich sowohl in geographischer als auch haushaltstechnischer Sicht beachtliche Auswirkungen haben wird .\n",
      "Den Kommissar möchte ich auffordern , in diesen beiden Bereichen tätig zu werden und uns dabei mit einzubinden .\n",
      "Angesichts der jüngsten Naturkatastrophen möchte ich doch noch auf die Verwendung der Strukturfondsmittel eingehen .\n",
      "Wir wissen , daß es den jeweiligen Staaten obliegt , einen Teil der Mittel selbst zu verteilen .\n",
      "Dabei darf es nicht angehen , daß - wie es anscheinend die Absicht der Mitgliedsstaaten ist - Europa überhaupt nicht mehr in Erscheinung tritt .\n",
      "Die Öffentlichkeit und die Presse werfen uns heute vor , nicht in Erscheinung zu treten , wo wir doch einen Großteil der Anstrengungen auf Ebene der einzelnen Staaten finanzieren .\n",
      "Ich glaube , wir können dies ruhig laut und deutlich sagen .\n",
      "Ich denke auch , daß immer wenn Europa Hilfe leistet , um die Schäden von Naturkatastrophen oder Unfällen zu beheben , wir über unsere Hilfsleistungen informieren bzw. die Mitgliedstaaten bitten sollten , dies zu übernehmen .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , finanz- und währungstechnischen Kriterien Priorität einzuräumen , bedeutet Ungleichheiten jeder Art zu verstärken .\n",
      "Französische Planungsexperten halten es zum Beispiel derzeit für sehr wahrscheinlich , daß sich die regionalen Unterschiede innerhalb der einzelnen Länder weiter vertiefen werden .\n",
      "Doch die Strukturfonds haben dazu beigetragen , diese Entwicklung zu bremsen .\n",
      "Unser Ziel ist ein Europa , das von einer Befriedigung der sozialen Bedürfnisse ausgeht , und dies setzt hinsichtlich der Lebensbedingungen eine Annäherung nach oben voraus .\n",
      "Die Umsetzung dieses Ziels bedeutet sicherlich eine Ausweitung von Umverteilungsinstrumenten wie die Strukturfonds .\n",
      "Wir denken insbesondere an eine einheitliche Kapitalsteuer , die es ermöglichen würde , Fonds zu speisen , die für eine Harmonisierung der Systeme der sozialen Sicherheit und eine Reduzierung der Arbeitszeit in Europa notwendig sind .\n",
      "Doch die Kommission , die die Aufgabe hat , Leitlinien vorzulegen , tut dies nur widerwillig und bleibt vage .\n",
      "Der heute vorliegende Bericht gibt der Politik ihre eigentliche Bedeutung zurück .\n",
      "Er ist ein Schritt in Richtung einer nachhaltigen Beschäftigungs- und Entwicklungspolitik .\n",
      "Und deshalb werden wir ihm zustimmen .\n",
      "Herr Präsident !\n",
      "Auch ich möchte die Berichterstatterin zu ihrer ausgezeichneten Arbeit beglückwünschen .\n",
      "Angesichts der Herausforderung der Globalisierung und der Osterweiterung bedarf Europa meines Erachtens in den nächsten Jahren für die Programmplanung und die Wiederankurbelung seiner Wirtschaft mehr denn je angemessener und exakter Vorgaben .\n",
      "In diesem Sinne müssen die Europäische Union als Ganzes und jeder Mitgliedstaat im besonderen von sämtlichen zu Gebote stehenden Mitteln und Möglichkeiten und damit auch von den vorhandenen Strukturfonds optimalen Gebrauch machen .\n",
      "Erforderlich dazu ist , daß die Europäische Kommission über die guten Vorsätze hinaus ihren Leitlinien mehr Transparenz verleiht und sich ganz gezielt um die Kontrolle der Verwendung dieser Mittel durch die Mitgliedstaaten bemüht .\n",
      "In Italien beispielsweise gab es in den letzten Jahren Probleme bei der Inanspruchnahme der Strukturfonds , wobei die Hauptgründe in einer aufgeblähten Bürokratie , in unzulänglichen Informationen sowie darin lagen , daß die Wirtschafts- und Sozialakteure auf lokaler Ebene zu wenig beteiligt wurden .\n",
      "Ich möchte daher die Kommission auf zwei Punkte hinweisen : Erstens muß die Konzertierung als Instrument der Koordinierung und der Beteiligung sämtlicher lokaler und regionaler Marktteilnehmer an den Entscheidungen optimal genutzt werden , um speziell Ungleichgewichte und Ungleichheiten zu vermeiden ; zweitens bedarf es einer Vereinfachung und transparenteren Gestaltung der Verwaltungsprozesse , die sich allzu häufig unnötig in die Länge ziehen und derart kompliziert sind , daß sie , was vor allem von den europäischen KMU beanstandet wird , ein Hindernis für den Zugang zu den Fonds darstellen .\n",
      "Abschließend halte ich es für ziemlich gravierend , daß den territorialen Beschäftigungspakten und vor allem den Modalitäten zur Bekämpfung der Frauen- und Jugendarbeitslosigkeit in der Mitteilung der Kommission wenig Beachtung geschenkt worden ist .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , mir ist es ebenso wie meinem Kollegen Herrn Evans eine besondere Freude , erstmals in diesem Haus zu diesem sehr wichtigen Problem das Wort zu ergreifen , zumal ich mit den West Midlands einen Teil des Vereinigten Königreichs vertrete , der bisher in den Genuß von Ziel-2-Fördermitteln gekommen ist .\n",
      "Doch der dem Haus heute vorliegende Bericht ist ein klassisches Beispiel dafür , daß wir , wenn wir nicht aufpassen , Ideen entwickeln , die zwar phantastisch klingen , für die Bürger , die direkt von ihnen profitieren sollen , jedoch u. U. von wenig Belang sind .\n",
      "Der Bericht selbst verfolgt eine gute Absicht , es fehlt ihm jedoch wie vielen unserer Aktivitäten auf diesem Gebiet an einer klaren Zielsetzung und einer soliden Grundlage für seine Umsetzung in die Praxis .\n",
      "Deshalb schlagen meine Fraktion und ich drei wichtige Änderungen und Zusätze vor , mit denen wir den Vorschlag in keiner Weise verwässern , sondern mit denen wir seine Relevanz für diejenigen , denen er als Anleitung dienen soll , erhöhen wollen .\n",
      "Lassen Sie mich das begründen .\n",
      "Es geht uns erstens um eine ordnungsgemäße Verwendung der Mittel aus den Struktur- und dem Kohäsionsfonds .\n",
      "Die Erfahrungen der Vergangenheit zeigen , daß wir als die gewählten Vertreter der europäischen Steuerzahler finanzielle Redlichkeit und Transparenz bei der Auszahlung dieser Gelder und der damit verbundenen Rechnungsprüfung fordern sollten , ja müssen .\n",
      "Mit unseren Änderungen und Zusätzen wollen wir das erreichen , was bei der Gewährung von Zuschüssen als Indikator für die wirtschaftlich günstigste Lösung dienen kann .\n",
      "Zweitens fließen nur allzu oft riesige Summen in Projekte , deren Ergebnisse sich zu Beginn des Programmzeitraums einfach noch nicht klar abschätzen lassen .\n",
      "Und bleibt der erhoffte Erfolg aus , gibt es keine effektive Möglichkeit , das Projekt zur Halbzeit oder am Ende dieses Zeitraums tatsächlich zu beenden .\n",
      "Mit unseren Zusätzen fordern wir daher , daß praktische und durchsetzbare Möglichkeiten des Ausstiegs aus einem Programm vorgesehen werden , mit denen wir uns nicht nur gegen weitere Kosten absichern , die häufig zu Lasten des Steuerzahlers gehen , sondern mit denen auch verhindert wird , daß , wie in der Vergangenheit so oft geschehen , Gelder verschwendet werden .\n",
      "Und schließlich fordern wir Veränderungen in bezug auf Schwerpunkt und Methodik der Mittelauszahlung .\n",
      "So sollte der private Sektor , durch den das Element der finanziellen Realität in die Finanzierungsüberlegungen eingebracht wird , stärker integriert werden .\n",
      "Auch sollte man hinsichtlich der Art der zu fördernden Projekte den Schwerpunkt von Kleinvorhaben auf Ertragsbasis , die sich nur schwer überwachen lassen , auf Investitionsvorhaben verlagern , bei denen der Nutzen in der Mehrzahl der Fälle offen auf der Hand liegt .\n",
      "Damit wird man den Rufen nach mehr Transparenz bei der Verwendung der Gelder gerecht , und der Versuchung , das lokale Steueraufkommen in Gebieten , in denen entsprechende Projekte durchgeführt werden , unnötig über längere Zeit zu belasten , wird erfolgreich entgegengewirkt .\n",
      "Zudem macht das Parlament damit deutlich , wie ernst es den Ruf nach derartigen Reformen nimmt .\n",
      "Diese Änderungen , sollten sie heute von diesem Hohen Haus angenommen werden , sind meiner Ansicht nach ein weiterer entscheidender Schritt zur Erreichung der historisch bedeutsamen Ziele , für die die Fonds ursprünglich eingerichtet worden waren , nämlich die finanziell nachhaltige Unterstützung der benachteiligten Gebiete in der Europäischen Union , in der der Lebensstandard nicht durch Almosen , sondern konkrete Hilfe auf ein menschenwürdiges Niveau angehoben werden muß .\n",
      "Ich fordere das Haus auf , diesen Änderungen zuzustimmen .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar , liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen !\n",
      "Auch ich möchte die Berichterstatterin zu ihrem mit so viel Fleiß und Sorgfalt erarbeiteten Bericht beglückwünschen .\n",
      "Zweifellos stellen die Strukturpolitiken und die Kohäsionspolitik der Europäischen Union die wesentlichen Instrumente dar , um die Voraussetzungen für das Wachstum und den Abbau der wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Ungleichgewichte in den Regionen zu schaffen .\n",
      "Trotz der bisherigen Maßnahmen sind diese Ungleichgewichte nämlich noch recht ausgeprägt , in bezug auf die Arbeitslosigkeit sogar inakzeptabel .\n",
      "Damit die Ziele dieser Politiken möglichst umfassend verwirklicht werden können , müssen sie koordiniert und auf der Grundlage wohldurchdachter , sinnvoller Leitlinien umgesetzt werden .\n",
      "Vergessen wir nicht , daß diese Politiken , wenn sie denn wirksam sind , auch für den europäischen Bürger sichtbar werden , der eine unmittelbare Verbesserung seiner Lebensqualität erkennt !\n",
      "Bedenken wir außerdem , daß die entlegenen und Inselregionen der Europäischen Union besondere Beachtung verdienen , denn auf Grund ihrer geographischen Lage sind sie in ihrer wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Entwicklung erheblich benachteiligt - es sei denn , die Kommission beabsichtigt , Brücken zu bauen oder unterseeische Tunnel anzulegen , um sie mit dem europäischen Festland zu verbinden .\n",
      "Lassen Sie mich abschließend anmerken , daß die Strukturpolitiken insgesamt flexibler gestaltet werden müssen , damit sie den veränderten Bedingungen und damit den neuen Herausforderungen und Chancen entsprechen , die das neue Jahrtausend , für das wir alle das Beste hoffen , mit sich bringt .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , der Bericht von Frau Schroedter enthält zweifellos zahlreiche wichtige Hinweise , und dazu möchte ich sie beglückwünschen .\n",
      "Wir sollten uns jedoch die Ausrichtung und die Ergebnisse der Regionalpolitik der Gemeinschaft mehr angelegen sein lassen .\n",
      "Hier stichpunktartig einige Probleme : Die enorme Massenarbeitslosigkeit wird nicht nur nicht abgebaut , sondern nimmt im Rahmen der Strukturpolitik noch schlimmere Ausmaße an .\n",
      "Die Landwirtschaft und die Agrarregionen erleiden infolge der praktizierten Regionalpolitik irreparable Schäden , was unheilvolle Konsequenzen für die Beschäftigung im ländlichen Raum und die Lebensbedingungen der Landwirte vor allem im Süden hat .\n",
      "Die regionalen Ungleichgewichte innerhalb der Mitgliedstaaten potenzieren sich in beängstigender Weise .\n",
      "Anhand der Daten des sechsten Berichts wird deutlich , daß das regionale Gefälle in den letzten zehn Jahren erheblich zugenommen hat .\n",
      "Den enormen Problemen der Inselregionen der Union , wo die Defizite in der Infrastruktur , im Verkehr , in der Kommunikation sowie im Energiebereich zu einer kontinuierlichen Abwanderung der Bevölkerung führen , wird fast keine oder überhaupt keine Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt .\n",
      "Verursacht wird diese Situation sowohl durch die Regional- als auch durch die Wirtschafts- und Sozialpolitik der Union generell .\n",
      "Breite Bevölkerungsschichten der Union prangern diese Politik nachdrücklich als gefährlich und volksfeindlich an .\n",
      "Leider gehen die neuen Leitlinien in dieselbe Richtung , und nichts deutet darauf hin , daß ihre Umsetzung daran etwas ändern wird .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , sehr geehrte Kollegen !\n",
      "Gestatten Sie mir , hier ein paar kurze Worte zu sagen , um zwei Punkte hervorzuheben , an die uns diese Berichte erinnern und die in der Vorstellung , die wir von der Union haben , eine wesentliche strategische Rolle spielen .\n",
      "Der erste ist die maßgebliche und zentrale Bedeutung , die wir dem Grundsatz des wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Zusammenhalts nach wie vor beimessen .\n",
      "Wir geben unserer Besorgnis über Meldungen Ausdruck , denen wir entnehmen , daß die Bedeutung dieses Ziels in den Anschauungen der Kommission zunehmend nachläßt .\n",
      "Wir sind nach wie vor der Ansicht , daß der wirtschaftliche und soziale Zusammenhalt ein zentrales Ziel der Union ist .\n",
      "Zweitens stimme ich dem zu , was ich hier bereits von einem Kollegen über die Thematik der Inseln gehört habe , und ich möchte ebenfalls auf die Gebiete in äußerster Randlage aufmerksam machen .\n",
      "In Zukunft würden wir uns über mehr Mut bei der Behandlung des Themas der Gebiete in äußerster Randlage freuen , wie das im Fall meines Heimatlandes für die Inselgruppen der Azoren und Madeiras gilt .\n",
      "Ich nutze diese Gelegenheit , um zu fragen , ob uns die Kommission über die Gründe aufklären kann , warum sich der Bericht der Kommission über die Gebiete in äußerster Randlage verzögert , der im Parlament seit längerem erwartet wird .\n",
      "Herr Präsident !\n",
      "Zunächst meinen Dank an die Berichterstatterin , auch für die bereitwillige Aufnahme von Anregungen unsererseits in den Bericht .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren , Herr Kommissar !\n",
      "Mit Hilfe von Leitlinien soll den Mitgliedstaaten eine Orientierung zum Erreichen der Reformziele im Rahmen der Programmierung angeboten werden .\n",
      "Die diesbezüglichen Vorgaben der Kommission stellen aber entgegen ihrem Anspruch , Orientierung zu geben , vielmehr einen Angebotskatalog möglicher Maßnahmen im Rahmen der Politikfelder dar .\n",
      "Richtung zu geben und Prioritäten zu setzen , ist jedoch ihr eigentlicher Sinn .\n",
      "Ich gehe mit der Berichterstatterin konform , daß das Kommissionsdokument leider zu wenig Empfehlungen an die Mitgliedstaaten zur Verwaltungsvereinfachung enthält , und unterstreiche Forderungen wie Konzentration bei Verhandlungen auf die Förderung eines günstigen Umfeldes für arbeitsintensive kleine und mittelständische Unternehmen , auf eine klare Zielsetzung für alternative Finanzierungsquellen einschließlich Regelungen für Risikokapital und private Finanzierung , auf betriebliche Starthilfen einschließlich neuer Informationstechnologien sowie Investitionen in innovativen Bereichen .\n",
      "Meine besondere Unterstützung gilt einem Änderungsantrag meiner Fraktion zu Ziffer 10 , der eine angemessene Einbeziehung des privaten Sektors bei der Planung und Durchführung der Projekte sicherstellen soll .\n",
      "Ich würde mich freuen , Frau Schroedter , wenn Sie diesen Änderungsantrag gerade auch unter dem Aspekt der Subsidiarität in Ihre positiven Erwägungen mit einbeziehen würden .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar !\n",
      "Im Ausschuß für Beschäftigung und soziale Angelegenheiten vertraten wir einhellig den Standpunkt , daß die Unterstützung der Interventionen der Struktur- und Kohäsionsfonds zugunsten besserer Beschäftigungschancen für die Arbeitslosen und einer Gleichstellung von Männern und Frauen von strategischer und prioritärer Bedeutung ist .\n",
      "Leider hat der ausgezeichnete Bericht Schroedter diesen Gedanken nicht in Betracht gezogen , obwohl es zahlreiche Beweise dafür gibt - wir werden das später im Bericht Berend sehen - , wie diese Fonds den weniger entwickelten Regionen wirklich hervorragend helfen , den Abstand zwischen ihnen und den am stärksten entwickelten Regionen Europas zu überbrücken .\n",
      "Sie wachsen , aber in bezug auf das BIP .\n",
      "Ihre Wettbewerbsfähigkeit steigt , aber der wachsende Reichtum erreicht nicht alle , weil sich die Zahl der Arbeitsplätze nicht erhöht und der Unterschied bei den Beschäftigungschancen in den einzelnen Regionen fortbesteht .\n",
      "Herr Kommissar , lesen Sie die Stellungnahme des Ausschusses für Beschäftigung und soziale Angelegenheiten , und räumen Sie ihr Vorrang ein , denn dies ist das große Problem der Bürger .\n",
      "Und berücksichtigen Sie bei der Überprüfung , bei der Zuweisung der Reserven , strategisch die Anforderungen an die Beschäftigung , denn dies ist es letztendlich , was die Struktur- und Kohäsionsfonds erfordern .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , die Leitlinien müssen so gestaltet werden , daß sie die Programme der wichtigen fünf Jahre von 2002 bis 2006 vernünftig ausrichten und ihre Effizienz verstärken , damit Ziele wie die nachhaltige Entwicklung sowie die Beschäftigungsförderung , insbesondere für Frauen und Jugendliche , endlich Wirklichkeit werden und die Ausgewogenheit zwischen der Wirtschafts- und Sozial- sowie der Umweltpolitik gewahrt bleibt .\n",
      "Besonders wichtig sind die Bewältigung der angewachsenen Probleme in den Städten , die Beschäftigungssicherung im ländlichen Raum , die Förderung der Agrarregionen und natürlich - wie in Artikel 158 des Vertrages vorgesehen - die Gewährung gleicher Entwicklungschancen für die Inseln der Europäischen Union , selbstverständlich auch für die griechischen , die die Hälfte der Inseln der Union ausmachen .\n",
      "Die Kohäsionspolitik muß weiter gestärkt werden , denn ein Europa mit einem beträchtlichen Gefälle im Lebensniveau zwischen den einzelnen Regionen ist weder glaubwürdig noch kann es Bestand haben .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , meine Damen und Herren Abgeordneten !\n",
      "Ich habe ihren Ausführungen , Ihrer stellenweisen Kritik sowie Ihren Vorschlägen im Zusammenhang mit dem Bericht von Frau Schroedter aufmerksam und mit großem Interesse zugehört .\n",
      "Wir alle , Frau Berichterstatterin , meine Damen und Herren , kennen die Gründe , die Termine , die Verzögerungen - ich komme gleich darauf zu sprechen .\n",
      "Doch heute diskutieren wir über den Bericht , der für mich und die Kommission zum richtigen Zeitpunkt vorliegt , da es um die Leitlinien 2000-2006 geht und wir gerade mit der neuen regionalen Programmplanungsphase beginnen .\n",
      "Frau Schroedter , Sie haben zu Recht daran erinnert , daß es im wesentlichen Aufgabe der Mitgliedstaaten und der Regionen ist , ihre eigenen Entwicklungsprioritäten festzulegen .\n",
      "Doch aufgrund der Kofinanzierung der Programme durch die Europäische Union ist es notwendig und richtig , daß auch gemeinschaftliche Prioritäten berücksichtigt werden , wie sie hier diskutiert und verabschiedet werden , um diese gemeinschaftliche Dimension des wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Zusammenhalts zu fördern , an die viele von Ihnen mit Nachdruck erinnert haben .\n",
      "Deshalb , meine Damen und Herren , möchte ich kurz auf die Bedeutung und Struktur der Leitlinien eingehen , bevor ich auf die Bemerkungen oder die Kritik , die Sie , Frau Schroedter , oder auch Sie , meine Damen und Herren , vorgebracht haben , zu sprechen komme .\n",
      "In bezug auf die Bedeutung und Struktur der Leitlinien haben der Ausschußvorsitzende Hatzidakis , die Berichterstatterin sowie Frau McCarthy daran erinnert , daß die Leitlinien den Zweck haben , die nationalen und regionalen Stellen bei der Vorbereitung ihrer Programmierungsstrategie für die Ziele 1 , 2 und 3 der Strukturfonds sowie deren Verbindungen zum Kohäsionsfonds zu unterstützen .\n",
      "Dabei geht es darum , die Prioritäten der Kommission , die von den Erfahrungen bei der Umsetzung der Programme ausgehen , sowie die derzeitigen Gemeinschaftspolitiken im Zusammenhang mit den Strukturmaßnahmen darzulegen .\n",
      "Diese Prioritäten sollen - wie hier mehrfach gefordert wurde - zu einer bessern Nutzung , einer optimalen , effizienten Nutzung der Gemeinschaftsinterventionen beitragen ; dazu gehört gegebenenfalls auch die Leistungsreserve , Herr Bradbourn , die insbesondere das Ziel hat , eine optimale und effiziente Verwendung der öffentlichen Gelder Europas sicherzustellen .\n",
      "Und wenn ich von optimaler Verwendung spreche , meine ich sowohl die nationale als auch die regionale Ebene ; und , Herr Seppänen , auf nationaler Ebene meine ich damit auch die Verbindung zum Kohäsionsfonds .\n",
      "Soviel zum Ziel der Leitlinien .\n",
      "In bezug auf den Inhalt wissen Sie , meine Damen und Herren Abgeordneten , daß die Leitlinien von drei strategischen Prinzipien ausgehen , an die die Berichterstatterin in ihren Ausführungen eben mit aller Deutlichkeit und gleichzeitig mit großem Nachdruck erinnert hat .\n",
      "Die erste Priorität liegt auf der Verbesserung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der regionalen Wirtschaft , um in allen Wirtschaftsbereichen , insbesondere aber im privaten Sektor , wie Herr Berend ausführte , möglichst viele vollwertige und auf Dauer angelegte Stellen zu schaffen ; Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Wirtschaft der Regionen , aller Regionen , insbesondere von Wales , Herr Evans , aber nicht nur von Wales .\n",
      "Hinzufügen möchte ich hier noch , weil einige Abgeordnete gerade darauf hingewiesen haben , da dies ihrer Meinung nach anscheinend vergessen wurde , die regionalen Wirtschaften der durch ihre Lage benachteiligten europäischen Regionen - also die Randregionen , die Inselregionen und natürlich auch die Regionen in äußerster Randlage .\n",
      "In diesem Zusammenhang möchte ich auf die Ausführungen von Herrn Ribeiro i Castro eingehen und ihm sagen , daß , die Kommission - wie ich an die jeweiligen Präsidenten der Regionen in äußerster Randlage geschrieben habe - um einige Wochen Fristverlängerung für die Vorlage ihres Berichts gebeten hat .\n",
      "Die Mitteilungen der einzelnen Regierungen zu den Regionen in äußerster Randlage haben wir ziemlich spät erhalten , doch soll das keine Entschuldigung , sondern eine Erklärung sein .\n",
      "Nun geht es darum , diese Unterlagen zu berücksichtigen und sehr sorgfältig auszuwerten .\n",
      "Am 23. November habe ich an einem Treffen von Vertretern der Regionen in äußerster Randlage teilgenommen , und wir waren uns in der Kommission einig , daß wir einige Wochen mehr Zeit brauchen , um einen Bericht vorlegen zu können , der den sehr schwerwiegenden und bedeutsamen Problemen sowie den Erwartungen dieser Regionen in äußerster Randlage gerecht wird ; ich danke Ihnen für Ihr Verständnis .\n",
      "So weit meine Ausführungen zur ersten Priorität , der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit auf regionaler Ebene .\n",
      "Die zweite Priorität , die auch von Ihnen mehrfach genannt wurde , insbesondere auch von Herrn Puerta - ich gehe im übrigen nicht von einer Rangfolge der Prioritäten untereinander aus - , liegt auf der Verbesserung des sozialen Zusammenhalts und der Beschäftigung , wobei in Zukunft insbesondere die Humanressourcen besser geförderte werden sollen .\n",
      "Meine Damen und Herren Abgeordneten , wenn man feststellen muß , daß in der Europäischen Union die Unterschiede zwischen den Staaten geringer geworden sind - was im übrigen für den Kohäsionsfonds und dessen Effizienz spricht - , aber gleichzeitig bei der Arbeitslosigkeit - wie die Berichterstatterin schreibt - die Unterschiede zwischen den 15 oder 20 reichsten Regionen und den 15 oder 20 ärmsten bzw. am stärksten benachteiligten Regionen größer geworden sind , dann ist das eine Situation , die unerträglich und durch nichts zu rechtfertigen ist .\n",
      "Aufgrund meinen Vorstellungen vom Aufbau Europas und von regionaler Entwicklungspolitik im besonderen halte ich das für eine Situation , die ich nicht akzeptieren kann .\n",
      "Ich habe die Absicht , im Rahmen meiner Möglichkeiten und mit Ihrer Unterstützung sämtliche Mittel , für die ich Verantwortung trage , für eine verbesserte soziale , menschliche und territoriale Kohäsion zu verwenden , um zu verhindern , daß es , wie ich es vor diesem Hause nannte , ein Europa der zwei Geschwindigkeiten gibt , ein Europa der schicken Stadtviertel und ein Europa der armen Vorstädte .\n",
      "Das dritte Ziel besteht in einer städtischen und ländlichen Entwicklung im Rahmen einer ausgewogenen Raumordnungspolitik .\n",
      "Die Leitlinien gehen im übrigen von zwei horizontalen Prinzipien aus : Die Entwicklung des ländlichen Raums - und die Frage einer nachhaltigen Verkehrsstruktur , Frau Berichterstatterin , die mir seit langem am Herzen liegt , insbesondere seit meiner Zeit als Umweltminister meines Landes , gehört für mich in den Bereich der Entwicklung des ländlichen Raums - und das zweite Prinzip ist die Chancengleichheit , insbesondere zwischen Frauen und Männern , sowie die europäische Beschäftigungsstrategie und die Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion .\n",
      "Frau Berichterstatterin , meine Damen und Herren Abgeordneten , zu Ihren in der Aussprache geäußerten Bedenken möchte ich sagen , daß in den Leitlinien auf die Bedeutung und die Festlegung von integrierten Entwicklungs- bzw. Umstellungsstrategien hingewiesen wird , damit die genannten Prioritäten größtmögliche Synergieeffekte der Maßnahmen und wirkungsvolle dezentrale Partnerschaften ermöglichen .\n",
      "Sie sind beunruhigt , weil auf diese Partnerschaft anscheinend nicht eingegangen worden ist .\n",
      "Sie wird aber auf Seite 5 dieser Leitlinien ganz eindeutig genannt , und ich möchte darauf verweisen - weil sie mich dazu aufgefordert haben - , daß diese Partnerschaft für mich - und ich habe lange genug eine Region betreut , um dies beurteilen zu können - ein sehr wirkungsvolles Instrument zur Mobilisierung der geistigen Ressourcen auf lokaler Ebene ist - sowohl derer im öffentlichen Sektor - die Stadt- und Gemeinderäte , den schulischen und gesellschaftlichen Bereich , die Vereine und Verbände - als auch derer des privaten Sektors .\n",
      "Und die territorialen Pakte sind , um auf eine Bemerkung von Frau Angelilli einzugehen , eine der Formen dieser dezentralen Partnerschaft .\n",
      "Die Leitlinien sind nach themenbezogenen Prioritäten geordnet , damit sie im Rahmen der einzelnen Ziele in unterschiedlichem Maße je nach der spezifischen Situation eines jeden Mitgliedstaats bzw. dessen Regionen berücksichtigt werden können .\n",
      "Nun , meine Damen und Herren , möchte ich kurz auf einige Ihrer Bemerkungen eingehen ; zunächst zum Verfahren .\n",
      "Es ist richtig , daß Ihr Haus erst spät mit der Sache befaßt worden ist .\n",
      "Ich möchte aber daran erinnern , daß , nachdem die Leitlinien von der Kommission in Form eines Entwurfs im Februar 1999 nach einem neuen Verfahren , bei dem die Abgabe von Stellungnahmen zum Text vereinfacht wurde , verabschiedet worden waren , sie von meiner Vorgängerin , Frau Monika Wulf-Mathies , sofort ans Parlament weitergeleitet wurden .\n",
      "Doch aufgrund der damals anstehenden Europawahlen konnte Ihr Haus erst nach der endgültigen Verabschiedung des Texts im Juli 1999 mit der Prüfung der Leitlinien beginnen .\n",
      "Heute nun kann ich Ihnen , meine Damen und Herren Abgeordneten , versichern , daß wir bei den Verhandlungen über die Programme erst am Anfang stehen - der Ausschußvorsitzende Herr Hatzidakis hat mich bereits dazu befragt - und daß daher Ihre Bemerkungen bei den meisten Mitgliedstaaten tatsächlich berücksichtigt werden können .\n",
      "Weiter kann ich Ihnen sagen , daß die Kommission die Meinung Ihres Hauses , die in diesem Bericht zum Ausdruck kommt , bei der Verabschiedung der Leitlinien für die vorgeschriebene sogenannte Halbzeitbewertung berücksichtigen wird .\n",
      "Jetzt zu inhaltlichen Aspekten der Leitlinien .\n",
      "Frau Berichterstatterin , Sie haben unterstrichen , daß es hier darum geht , zu einer Reihe von oft sehr präzise festgelegten europäischen Zielen Vorgaben zu machen .\n",
      "Ich kann jetzt nicht alle nennen : Einführung von sektorübergreifenden Maßnahmen , effizientere Nutzung öffentlicher Gelder , Unterstützung der unterschiedlichen Partner bei der gemeinsamen Entwicklung von regionalen oder nationalen Programmen usw. Die Kommission nimmt dies zur Kenntnis , doch gehören diese Vorgaben bzw. Fragestellungen zum Teil nicht hierher , sondern zum Beispiel in das Vademecum oder das methodische Dokument .\n",
      "Abschließend , Frau Berichterstatterin , möchte ich mich auf einige Gedanken Ihres Berichts konzentrieren .\n",
      "Ich denke zum Beispiel an die Aussage , daß die Leitlinien hinsichtlich ihrer Empfehlungen nicht ausreichend spezifisch sind .\n",
      "Diese Aussage muß aber aus der Perspektive der Verhandlungen im letzten Frühjahr gesehen werden .\n",
      "Die Kommission hat sich an den Wortlaut von Artikel 10 der allgemeinen Strukturfondsverordnung gehalten , der die Leitlinien als \" allgemeine indikative Leitlinien auf der Basis einschlägiger und vereinbarter Gemeinschaftspolitiken \" definiert .\n",
      "Das war direkt nach dem Wortlauf der Verordnung zitiert - in Anführungszeichen .\n",
      "Und Leitlinien sind auch kein Ersatz für die Programmplanung oder die ex-ante-Bewertungen , die dazu dienen , die Prioritäten und die Effizienz der Programme zu bestimmen .\n",
      "Ferner führen Sie , Frau Berichterstatterin , hinsichtlich des Punktes \" Leitlinien für die Entwicklung im ländlichen und städtischen Raum \" aus , daß auf die städtische Entwicklung nur am Rande eingegangen werde .\n",
      "Mir scheint , daß eher das Gegenteil richtig ist .\n",
      "Ich kann Ihnen bestätigen , daß die Kommission im Bereich der Kohäsionspolitik dieser städtischen Dimension große Bedeutung beimißt und auch in Zukunft beimessen wird .\n",
      "Dies habe ich auch vor kurzem vor den für Stadtentwicklung zuständigen Ministern bei einer Tagung in Tampere ausgeführt .\n",
      "Bei der ländlichen Entwicklung , die hier mehrfach angesprochen wurde , insbesondere auch von Frau Redendo Jiménez , verfolgen die Leitlinien die von der Berichterstatterin angesprochene doppelte Zielsetzung : eine starke Landwirtschaft mit einer verbesserten Wettbewerbsfähigkeit in den ländlichen Gebieten , aber auch Umweltschutz und Pflege des ländlichen Kulturguts .\n",
      "Hier muß allerdings bedacht werden , daß diese Leitlinien , von denen wir sprechen , lediglich die Strukturfonds betreffen , deren Ziele 1 und 2 insbesondere für den ländlichen Raum einer Diversifizierung Priorität einräumen .\n",
      "Was nun dieses Gleichgewicht im ländlichen Raum betrifft , so dürfen wir hier die neue Politik der Entwicklung des ländlichen Raums , die über den EAGFL \" Garantie \" kofinanziert wird , nicht vergessen .\n",
      "Sie hat das Ziel , die Reform der europäischen Landwirtschaft voranzutreiben und die Multifunktionalität in der Landwirtschaft zu fördern .\n",
      "Ich möchte heute dazu nur sagen , daß ich mir wünsche , daß dieser Punkt in die Programmierung der ländlichen Ziel-2-Gebiete aufgenommen wird , wie dies mit dem EAGFL \" Ausrichtung \" für die Ziel-1-Regionen der Fall ist .\n",
      "Auf jeden Fall ist mir klar geworden , daß Ihr Ausschuß für Landwirtschaft und ländliche Entwicklung diesen Aspekt aufmerksam weiterverfolgen wird .\n",
      "Bevor ich zum Schluß komme , möchte ich Herrn Savary noch sagen , daß morgen eine gesonderte Aussprache über die Auswirkungen der Stürme der letzten Wochen insbesondere in Frankreich , Österreich und Deutschland vorgesehen ist und daß ebenfalls morgen Gelegenheit besteht , mit meiner Kollegin De Palacio über die aus der Ölpest in Frankreich zu ziehenden Schlußfolgerungen zu sprechen .\n",
      "Ich werde mich jetzt darauf beschränken , Herr Abgeordneter , Ihnen meine Auffassung mitzuteilen , die sich in großen Teilen mit Ihrer eigenen Einschätzung , was wir mit Ziel 2 für die Bekämpfung der Ölpest erreichen können , deckt .\n",
      "Ich weise darauf hin , daß die Kommission morgen die Ziel-2-Fördergebietskarten für Frankreich , Schweden , Österreich und Luxemburg bestätigen wird .\n",
      "Wir werden dann ein Arbeitsinstrument zur Verfügung haben , das wir insbesondere in einem Großteil der von den Stürmen betroffenen Departements einsetzen können .\n",
      "Aus diesem Grunde werde ich übrigens übermorgen in zwei französische Departements reisen , die unter den Stürmen besonders stark zu leiden hatten .\n",
      "Abschließend - vielen Dank , Herr Präsident , für Ihr Verständnis - möchte ich Ihnen , Frau Berichterstatterin , für Ihren Bericht danken ; Sie und Ihr Ausschuß haben gute Arbeit geleistet .\n",
      "Abgesehen von gewissen Meinungsunterschieden hinsichtlich der Rolle der Leitlinien - wir haben darüber gesprochen und ich habe versucht , Ihnen meinen Standpunkt zu erläutern - freue ich mich sehr darüber , wie Ihr Haus die Ausarbeitung dieser Leitlinien , die den Mitgliedstaaten zur Vorbereitung ihrer eigenen Programme dienen , unterstützt .\n",
      "Dies bestärkt uns darin , an unserem Konzept festzuhalten , das auf einer Reihe von bewährten Praktiken aus der laufenden Programmphase 1994 / 1999 beruht .\n",
      "Ich halte das zu Beginn der Programmplanung 2000 / 2006 für ein gutes Vorzeichen für die Zusammenarbeit unserer beiden Institutionen , für eine Bestätigung unserer gemeinsamen Arbeit , die , Herr Hatzidakis , durch den Verhaltenskodex , der unsere beiden Institutionen bindet und dessen Einhaltung mir sehr am Herzen liegt , gestärkt wird .\n",
      "Die Aussprache ist geschlossen .\n",
      "Die Abstimmung findet morgen um 12.00 Uhr statt .\n",
      " \n",
      "Sozio-ökonomische Lage und Entwicklung der Regionen Nach der Tagesordnung folgt die Aussprache über den Bericht ( A5-0107 / 1999 ) von Herrn Berend im Namen der Ausschusses für Regionalpolitik , Verkehr und Fremdenverkehr über den Sechsten Periodischen Bericht über die sozio-ökonomische Lage und Entwicklung der Regionen der Europäischen Union ( SEK ( 99 ) 0066 - C5-0120 / 99 - 1999 / 2123 ( COS ) ) .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar Barnier , meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren , liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen !\n",
      "Der sechste periodische Bericht enthält eine umfassende und detaillierte Beschreibung der wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Lage in den Regionen der Union und ihrer Entwicklungstendenzen und stellt , wie ich meine , eine solide Grundlage für die Formulierung von strukturpolitischen Prioritäten auf Unionsebene dar .\n",
      "Der Bericht zeigt , daß - gemessen am Bruttoinlandsprodukt pro Kopf - ein Aufholprozeß der ärmsten Regionen stattgefunden hat und sich auch weiter fortsetzt .\n",
      "Dies ist zu einem großen Teil auf die Strukturfonds zurückzuführen , auch wenn das Gefälle zwischen den ärmsten und den reichsten Gebieten weiterhin beträchtlich ist .\n",
      "Es hat durch den Einsatz der europäischen Strukturfonds bereits eine Annäherung der Lebensverhältnisse stattgefunden .\n",
      "Der Abstand des durchschnittlichen Bruttoinlandsproduktes in zehn Jahren hat sich um 10 % verringert .\n",
      "Hier besonders betroffen - natürlich im positiven Sinne - sind die vier Kohäsionsländer und auch die fünf neuen deutschen Bundesländer .\n",
      "Leider erfolgte diese Entwicklung europaweit hauptsächlich durch eine Steigerung der Produktivität und nur in geringem Maße durch Beschäftigungswachstum .\n",
      "Deshalb fordern wir die Kommission und die Mitgliedstaaten auf , in Zukunft auch der Beschäftigungswirkung von Maßnahmen angemessene Beachtung zu schenken .\n",
      "Ein Großteil der Transferzahlungen wurde und wird für Rationalisierungs- und Modernisierungsinvestitionen verwendet , mit dem Ziel , Arbeitsproduktivität zu verbessern .\n",
      "Dies hat allerdings die Beschäftigungseffekte der Strukturpolitik entsprechend gedämpft .\n",
      "Das ist keine Wertung , sondern lediglich zunächst einmal eine Feststellung .\n",
      "Der Bericht weist aber nach , daß sich regionale Unterschiede auf dem Arbeitsmarkt sogar weiter verschärft haben .\n",
      "In 25 schwächsten Regionen beträgt heute die Arbeitslosigkeit 24 % .\n",
      "Vor zehn Jahren war sie noch um 4 % niedriger , also 20 % .\n",
      "Und in den 25 besten Regionen , um das auch einmal zu erwähnen , haben wir heute eine durchschnittliche Arbeitslosigkeit von 3,6 % , vor zehn Jahren 2,5 % , also eine Steigerung von nur 1,1 % .\n",
      "Im Bericht wird deutlich , daß 50 % der Arbeitslosigkeit strukturelle Arbeitslosigkeit ist .\n",
      "Deshalb muß , und das ist eine Schlußfolgerung aus diesem Bericht , die Förderung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der gewerblichen Wirtschaft , die Förderung von wirtschaftsnaher Infrastruktur im Mittelpunkt der Strukturpolitik stehen .\n",
      "Hier ist Reihenfolge auch gleich Rangfolge .\n",
      "In diesem Zusammenhang - das soll auch gleich anschließend mit gesagt werden - sind nicht zuletzt auch Maßnahmen zur Umschulung und Weiterbildung der Arbeitskräfte zu nennen .\n",
      "Des weiteren muß der Stärkung der unternehmerischen Potentiale in den kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen mehr Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt werden , und die Dienste für KMU müssen weiterentwickelt werden .\n",
      "Eine weitere Schlußfolgerung aus dem Bericht besteht darin , daß im Sinne eines effizienten Fördermitteleinsatzes die Abstimmung von Fördermaßnahmen mit der breit gefächerten Mittelstands- und Existenzgründungsförderung erfolgen muß .\n",
      "Ein sehr wichtiger Punkt , wie ich meine .\n",
      "Im Ergebnis dieses Berichtes machen wir die Kommission darauf aufmerksam , daß die rechtlichen Grundlagen für eine Zusammenarbeit zwischen Regionen und Mitgliedstaaten und Beitrittskandidatenländern verbessert werden müssen , und weisen auf die besondere Notwendigkeit der Budgetkonsolidierung als Voraussetzung für den Erfolg der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion und der Erweiterung nach Osten hin .\n",
      "Wir fordern diejenigen Mitgliedstaaten , die noch keine ausreichende Fördergebietskarte eingereicht haben , auf , dies umgehend zu tun , und erwarten von der Kommission natürlich auch , daß sie die operationellen Programme der Regionen für die neue Förderperiode von 2000 bis 2006 im Lichte dieser Ergebnisse des sechsten periodischen Berichtes zügig prüft und alles tut , damit diese Förderperiode ohne zeitliche Verzögerung auch vor Ort ordentlich beginnen kann .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar Barnier , liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen !\n",
      "Dieser Sechste periodische Bericht über die sozio-ökonomische Lage und Entwicklung der Regionen der Europäischen Union stellt eine neue Etappe in der Analyse regionsspezifischer Daten dar und macht die seit Erscheinen des Fünften Periodischen Berichts erzielten Fortschritte deutlich .\n",
      "Ich bin jedoch der Meinung , daß man der realen Situation nicht ganz gerecht wird , wenn man von einer wirklichen Annäherung des durchschnittlichen regionalen Entwicklungsstands in Europa spricht .\n",
      "Leider wird dieses Bild aber in der Presse oder in bestimmten Reden vermittelt .\n",
      "Der Bericht der Kommission relativiert diese Einschätzung sehr deutlich , insbesondere da , wo er die sozio-ökonomische Lage bestimmter Regionen , die mir besonders am Herzen liegen , beschreibt .\n",
      "Ich meine die französischen überseeischen Departements und ganz allgemein die Regionen in äußerster Randlage .\n",
      "Ich freue mich , daß der Ausschuß für Regionalpolitik einen meiner Änderungsanträge angenommen hat , der die Kommission auffordert , in ihrem nächsten Bericht ein gesondertes Kapitel über Kohäsion in Gebieten in äußerster Randlage aufzunehmen , insbesondere eine Analyse der Wirkung der Maßnahmen , die demnächst entsprechend des neuen Artikels 299 Absatz 2 des Amsterdamer Vertrags getroffen werden .\n",
      "Der Sechste Periodische Bericht enthält schließlich hinsichtlich des Ziels einer ausgewogenen und nachhaltigen Entwicklung in Europa einige interessante Argumente , insbesondere wo er auf die Bedeutung der Beziehungen zwischen dem Zentrum Europas und seiner Peripherie verweist .\n",
      "Auch wenn die Kommission noch zögert , explizit darauf hinzuweisen , zeigt der Periodische Bericht doch , wie dringlich eine polyzentrische Entwicklung des gemeinschaftlichen Raums mittels einer Strukturpolitik der Union und im Rahmen des ESVG-Ansatzes ist .\n",
      "Herr Präsident !\n",
      "Die Fraktion der Sozialdemokratischen Partei Europas in diesem Parlament ist mit dem von Herrn Berend vorgetragenen Bericht einverstanden und beglückwünscht seinen Verfasser sowohl zur Qualität seiner Schlußfolgerungen als auch zu seiner Flexibilität , durch die im Ausschuß Änderungsanträge der verschiedenen Fraktionen aufgenommen werden konnten .\n",
      "Es muß daran erinnert werden , daß die globale Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Europäischen Union gegenwärtig 81 % des Niveaus der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika erreicht und daß diese Kennziffer sich nur dann verbessern wird , wenn sich die unserer wettbewerbsfähigen Wirtschaftseinheiten , nämlich der Regionen , verbessert , und das zu einem Zeitpunkt , da die technologische Entwicklung , die Globalisierung der Wirtschaft und unsere Probleme , die Erweiterung und die Einheitswährung , von den Regionen , aber auch den Unternehmen und dem Einzelnen größere Wettbewerbsanstrengungen fordern .\n",
      "Der Sechste Bericht der Europäischen Kommission bietet sehr wertvolle Schlußfolgerungen .\n",
      "Ich möchte zwei davon kurz zusammenfassen , der Berichterstatter hat sie schon aufgegriffen , eine positive und eine negative .\n",
      "Die erste bezieht sich darauf , daß bedeutsame Fortschritte in der territorialen und sozialen Kohäsion im gesamten Gebiet der Union erreicht worden sind und die Gemeinschaftsfonds einen wichtigen , wenn auch nicht entscheidenden Faktor beim Abbau der regionalen Ungleichheiten darstellen .\n",
      "Die negative ist , daß diese großen Anstrengungen bei der Angleichung des BIP und der Produktivität der europäischen Regionen eine größere Wirkung zeigten als bei der Angleichung ihrer Beschäftigungsniveaus .\n",
      "Deshalb ist es erforderlich , die strukturelle Finanzierung stärker an die Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen zu binden .\n",
      "Das , Herr Kommissar , ist das erste Gebot für den kommenden Zeitraum .\n",
      "Somit , Herr Präsident , bitte ich meine verehrten Kolleginnen und Kollegen um die Zustimmung zu diesem Bericht und , wie andere Kollegen vor mir , ersuche ich die Kommission , die Schlußfolgerungen aus ihrem Sechsten Periodischen Bericht im Hinblick auf die Planung des Zeitraums 2000-2006 genau zu berücksichtigen .\n",
      "Herr Präsident !\n",
      "Herr Kommissar !\n",
      "Sehr geehrte Kollegen !\n",
      "Zunächst möchte ich dem Berichterstatter für die geleistete gute Arbeit und die sachliche Berücksichtigung der eingegangenen Änderungsvorschläge während der Behandlung im Ausschuß danken .\n",
      "Der sechste periodische Bericht ist eine gute Grundlage für die Bewertung der Durchsetzung der regionalpolitischen Ziele in der Union und zeigt , daß sich das Wachstum trotz aller Bemühungen nur ungleichmäßig vollzieht .\n",
      "Die Regionen Mitteleuropas weisen nach wie vor ein besonders schnelles Wachstum auf , das sich in den starken Wirtschaftszentren in einem Tempo vollzieht , welches über dem gesamteuropäischen Durchschnitt liegt , während viele südeuropäische und nördliche Regionen erheblich langsamer vorankommen .\n",
      "Jetzt bedarf es einer tiefgreifenden Analyse zu der Frage , warum die Regionalpolitik nicht in allen Gebieten den gewünschten Erfolg hat .\n",
      "Liegt es an der Bürokratie oder sind die Unterschiede zwischen den Regionen , die großen Entfernungen , sehr kaltes oder heißes Klima , dünne Besiedlung und karge Bedingungen nicht ausreichend berücksichtigt worden ?\n",
      "Wie gelingt es der Union , den Herausforderungen der globalen Entwicklung so zu begegnen , daß auch die schwächer entwickelten Regionen mithalten können ?\n",
      "Wichtig ist auch , die Auswirkungen der Erweiterung auf die Strukturfonds und die Entwicklung der Gebiete in äußerster Randlage zu untersuchen .\n",
      "Hier dürfen sich die Mitgliedstaaten auch nicht ihrer Verantwortung entziehen .\n",
      "Einige Länder haben das Prinzip der Kofinanzierung verletzt und die nationalen Mittel für die Regionen gekürzt , während die regionalen Beihilfen der Union aufgestockt wurden .\n",
      "Das ging zu Lasten der Regionalpolitik .\n",
      "Künftig muß auch über die Aufstellung von Indikatoren nachgedacht werden , durch die Maßnahmen zur rechten Zeit für den rechten Ort ausgerichtet werden können .\n",
      "Zum Beispiel ist die unkontrollierte Migration nicht ausreichend berücksichtigt worden .\n",
      "Auch in diesem Zusammenhang muß die entscheidende Bedeutung der kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen als Motor für Beschäftigung und regionale Entwicklung hervorgehoben werden .\n",
      "Sehr wichtig ist die Einführung der modernsten Technik und des neuesten Know-how bei Unternehmen in Regionen mit Entwicklungsrückstand .\n",
      "Unsere Fraktion befürwortet die Annahme des vorliegenden Berichts .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar , sehr geehrte Kollegen !\n",
      "Bis heute ist es in der Regionalpolitik der Europäischen Gemeinschaft nicht gelungen , die bestehenden Unterschiede bei der Pro-Kopf-Leistung signifikant zum Ausdruck zum bringen .\n",
      "Die Lage ist ernst , denn es gibt heute sogar in der Europäischen Union einen offensichtlichen Zusammenhang zwischen Arbeitslosigkeit und Armut , wie die äußerst besorgniserregende Tatsache beweist , daß die Arbeitslosigkeit in den von diesem Problem am stärksten betroffenen Regionen durchschnittlich 23,7 % erreicht , und diese Regionen decken sich mit Armutsgebieten , während in den 25 Regionen mit geringerer Arbeitslosigkeit , die den wohlhabenden Gebieten entsprechen , die Arbeitslosigkeit nur bei 4 % liegt .\n",
      "Angesichts dieser Situation muß aus dem Bericht , den das Parlament annimmt , klar hervorgehen , daß Maßnahmen notwendig sind , die eindeutig auf die Bekämpfung der relativen Armut und der Arbeitslosigkeit gerichtet sind .\n",
      "Maßnahmen wie die für diese Zwecke angemessene Verwendung der Strukturfonds , die häufig unsachgemäß eingesetzt werden , und zwar mit zentralen staatlichen Politiken , die Modernisierung der Bereiche Telekommunikation und Kommunikation , indem man vor allem die am wenigsten entwickelten Regionen bis voraussichtlich 2007 in die transeuropäischen Eisenbahnnetze einbindet , die Berücksichtigung und Entwicklung der Agrar- und Fischereiressourcen und -kapazitäten dieser Länder , die oft gerade von den Politiken einer gleichgültigen Europäischen Union benachteiligt werden , die Förderung aktiver beschäftigungspolitischer Konzepte , hauptsächlich für Frauen und Jugendliche .\n",
      "Nur mit der konsequenten Durchführung solcher Maßnahmen wird es möglich sein , ein soziales und regionales Ungleichgewicht zu überwinden , das nicht das historische Ergebnis unabwendbarer Schwächen , sondern von Ausgrenzung und Wirtschaftspolitiken mit negativen Auswirkungen ist .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar !\n",
      "Der vorliegende Bericht des Kollegen Berend folgt genau der von der Europäischen Kommission bestimmten Strategie , indem die Frage der Steigerung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit absolut in den Vordergrund gerückt wird .\n",
      "Übergreifende Zielsetzung der Strukturfonds , wie zum Beispiel verstärkte Schaffung von Beschäftigung , stärkere Gewährleistung der Chancengleichheit , Erhöhung der Dauerhaftigkeit von Beschäftigung und Entwicklung , werden nur am Rande erwähnt .\n",
      "Diese Sichtweise erscheint mir ungerechtfertigt , und ich würde auch bitten , daß diese Punkte in dem siebten periodischen Bericht sehr viel stärker zum Tragen kommen .\n",
      "Das bedeutet nicht , daß ich nicht die Notwendigkeit von Wettbewerbsstärke sehe , um so mehr , als ich selbst Unternehmer in einem Ziel 1-Gebiet bin , und zwar in Brandenburg in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland , und sehr wohl die Sorgen und Nöte von klein- und mittelständischen Unternehmen kenne .\n",
      "In den Ziel 1-Regionen sind zeitlich befristete Maßnahmen parallel dazu unbedingt erforderlich , nämlich Arbeitsbeschaffungsmaßnahmen , spezielle Programme für die Förderung von Frauenerwerbstätigkeit und Initiativen zur Förderung des Beginns von selbständiger Tätigkeit .\n",
      "Sie werden durch geeignete Aktivitäten aus den Strukturfonds der Europäischen Union unterstützt .\n",
      "Allein die Unterstützung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit von Unternehmen kann die anvisierte Kohäsion zwischen wirtschaftlicher und sozialer Entwicklung niemals kompensieren , weil einfach die Grundlagen für einen selbsttragenden Aufschwung in diesen Ziel 1-Regionen fehlen .\n",
      "Und die Erfahrung , daß wirtschaftliche Entwicklung allein nicht dazu beiträgt , Arbeitslosigkeit abzubauen , untermauert doch die Tatsache , daß man mindestens 3 % Steigerung des Bruttosozialprodukts benötigt , um überhaupt zusätzliche Arbeitsplätze zu schaffen .\n",
      "Die ausschließliche Konzentration auf nachfrageorientierte , angebotsorientierte Wirtschaftpolitik kann so nicht funktionieren .\n",
      "Und wenn man die schon betreibt , muß man größtenteils Erweiterungsinvestitionen tätigen und weniger Rationalisierungsinvestitionen .\n",
      "Man muß das unbedingt koppeln mit einer nachfrageorientierten Wirtschaftspolitik , damit wir überhaupt die Chance haben , die soziale Situation in diesen Gebieten zu verbessern .\n",
      "In den Regionen sind diese Situationen sehr , sehr unterschiedlich .\n",
      "Das heißt , es bedarf eben auch einer Menge begleitender Maßnahmen , um dort überhaupt etwas machen zu können .\n",
      "Das wären zum Beispiel Maßnahmen zur beruflichen Ausbildung , zur Weiterbildung , zur Wiedereingliederung von Menschen , die bereits aus dem Produktionsprozeß vertrieben worden sind , zur flexiblen Gestaltung von Arbeitszeit und Arbeitszeitformen , um persönliche und soziale Aspekte entschieden besser in Einklang bringen zu können und vielleicht auch die Erwerbstätigkeit von Frauen wieder zu fördern .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , mein Kompliment an den Berichterstatter für seinen detaillierten Bericht .\n",
      "Mit den Strukturfonds soll im wesentlichen die wirtschaftliche und soziale Kohäsion zwischen den Regionen der Europäischen Union verbessert werden .\n",
      "Mit Hilfe von Investitionsanreizen verschiedenster Art bemüht sich die Europäische Union um eine Steigerung des BIP pro Kopf sowie um Beschäftigungswachstum .\n",
      "Aus dem sechsten Periodischen Bericht über die Regionen kann man vorsichtig schlußfolgern , daß diese Anreize recht oft nicht den gewünschten Erfolg zeitigen .\n",
      "Die auf die Steigerung des Pro-Kopf-BIP in den Ziel-1-Regionen ausgerichteten Bemühungen führen nicht immer zu diesem Wachstum .\n",
      "Nicht eben ein befriedigendes Ergebnis in einer Zeit , die , vor allem in den letzten Jahren , von wirtschaftlichem Aufschwung geprägt war .\n",
      "Wie der Berichterstatter ausführt , ist außerdem eine Beschäftigungswirkung der Strukturmaßnahmen kaum zu spüren .\n",
      "Deshalb halte ich es für angezeigt , bei der Bewertung der Effizienz gemeinschaftlicher Beihilfen Zurückhaltung zu üben .\n",
      "Auch die Feststellung , daß die Unterschiede zwischen den Regionen in den Mitgliedstaaten sich mitunter sogar verschärfen , wirft ernste Fragen auf .\n",
      "Mir erscheint es deshalb sinnvoll und notwendig , unsere Aufmerksamkeit , eben wenn es um Beschäftigungsanreize geht , sowohl auf die nationalen als auch auf die regionalen Behörden zu richten .\n",
      "Gerade sie kennen doch die Regionen in ihrem Verantwortungsbereich am besten .\n",
      "Indem sie maßgeschneiderte Programme für die jeweiligen Regionen entwickeln und dafür erforderlichenfalls Mittel bewilligen können , läßt sich ein größerer Effekt erzielen .\n",
      "Und darum geht es doch letztendlich .\n",
      "Deshalb begrüße ich es , wenn die Kommission die praktische Ausarbeitung und die Durchführung von Maßnahmen den Mitgliedstaaten und Regionen überläßt .\n",
      "Es ist in diesem Zusammenhang ohnehin sicherlich auch sinnvoller , bei den Fördermitteln für die Regionen mehr Gewicht auf die Mitgliedstaaten zu legen .\n",
      "Mit der Verlagerung der Kriterien von den Regionen auf die Mitgliedstaaten können wir eine Menge künftiger Probleme vermeiden .\n",
      "Zum Schluß möchte ich auf die Lage der mittel- und osteuropäischen Länder hinweisen .\n",
      "Wie aus dem Bericht hervorgeht , haben sie meist , insbesondere beim Pro-Kopf-BIP , einen signifikanten Rückstand zu den Ländern der Europäischen Union .\n",
      "In Anbetracht des in absehbarer Zeit geplanten Beitritts etlicher dieser Länder halte ich es für dringend geboten , die derzeitige Strukturpolitik zu überprüfen .\n",
      "Wie viele andere appelliere auch ich an die Kommission , zügig Reformvorschläge zu unterbreiten .\n",
      "Sehr geehrter Herr Präsident , werte Kollegen , Herr Kommissar !\n",
      "Nach genauem Studium des vorliegenden Berichts kommt man unzweifelhaft zu dem Schluß , daß das vorgegebene Ziel der Strukturpolitik nur teilweise erfüllt werden konnte .\n",
      "So hat u. a. die Disparität zwischen den Regionen eher zu- als abgenommen , die Mitgliedstaaten selbst verzeichnen hier eine gewisse Annäherung .\n",
      "Ebenso konnten die Arbeitslosenzahlen in den am stärksten betroffenen Regionen kaum gesenkt werden , teilweise sind sie sogar gestiegen .\n",
      "Ich frage mich also , woran es liegt , daß die Strukturfondsmittel nicht effizienter eingesetzt wurden .\n",
      "Selbst die Kumulierung von Geldern aus dem Kohäsionsfonds und den Strukturfonds hat nicht in allen Regionen und Ländern den gewünschten Erfolg gebracht .\n",
      "Nachdem europaweit das erklärte Ziel aller Politiker die Senkung der Arbeitslosigkeit ist , muß man die kritische Frage stellen , ob die angewandte Politik die richtige ist oder ob es nicht zweckmäßiger ist , die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Regionen durch entsprechende Maßnahmen wie gesteigerte Förderung von Forschung und Entwicklung , Verbesserung der Infrastruktur , Erhöhung des Ausbildungsniveaus zu stärken ?\n",
      "Ernsthafte Strukturreformen und eine wettbewerbsfreundliche Steuer- und Abgabenpolitik sind die Bausteine eines erfolgreichen Wirtschaftsstandortes .\n",
      "Wenn wir uns nicht den Vorwurf gefallen lassen wollen , eine kostenintensive Strukturpolitik zu betreiben , die in der Frage der Beschäftigung nichts nachhaltig bewegt , müssen die bisherigen Maßnahmen hinterfragt werden .\n",
      "Erfolgreich ist die Strukturpolitik der Union dann , wenn es gelingt , ausreichend Arbeitsplätze zu schaffen und die Arbeitslosenquote signifikant sinkt .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar , sehr verehrte Kollegen !\n",
      "Mein Dank gilt dem Berichterstatter für die Behandlung dieses sehr wichtigen Themas .\n",
      "Die Entwicklung der sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Lage ist schließlich entscheidend dafür , wie die Bürger Europas den Erfolg unserer Arbeit bewerten .\n",
      "Für die Glaubwürdigkeit der EU sind die Probleme , mit denen die Menschen tagtäglich zu kämpfen haben , von entscheidender Bedeutung .\n",
      "Wir müssen zugeben , daß die EU die Entwicklung der ärmeren Länder bereits - nach meinem Dafürhalten sogar sehr großzügig - unterstützt hat .\n",
      "Wenn ich mir vor Augen halte , wie es in Portugal und Griechenland aussah , als ich diese Länder vor 25 Jahren zum ersten Mal bereiste , dann ziehe ich den Hut vor der EU oder , wie die Franzosen sagen : \" coup de chapeau \" .\n",
      "Die EU hat diesen Respekt wirklich verdient .\n",
      "In den Ländern selbst gibt es aber nach wie vor zu große Unterschiede zwischen armen und reichen Regionen .\n",
      "Was sind die Folgen ?\n",
      "Die Menschen reagieren , indem sie mit den Füßen abstimmen und ihre Heimat verlassen .\n",
      "So müssen wir für dieselben Menschen desselben Landes mehrfach Schulen , Krankenhäuser und die gesamte Infrastruktur neu bauen .\n",
      "Das ist eine sehr teure Angelegenheit und führt darüber hinaus zu großen sozialen Problemen .\n",
      "Die meisten Menschen würden jedoch gern dort wohnen bleiben , wo sie geboren sind , wenn ihnen die Möglichkeit dazu geboten würde , also wenn sie Arbeit hätten .\n",
      "Wir müssen ihnen diese Möglichkeit geben .\n",
      "Es geht um eine moralische Pflicht , die der EU und uns allen auferlegt ist .\n",
      "Eine Lösung sehe ich in einer spürbaren Förderung des Unternehmertums .\n",
      "Darunter verstehe ich allerdings nicht nur , ein Unternehmen zu besitzen , sondern den Willen , ein Unternehmen zu führen .\n",
      "Ich meine eine Haltung , die den Menschen veranlaßt , in seinem Leben voranzukommen , sei es als Arbeitnehmer , Unternehmer oder Beamter .\n",
      "Wie sieht eine gerechte Gesellschaft aus ?\n",
      "Es handelt sich um eine Gesellschaft , in der auch ein Mensch aus bescheidenen Verhältnissen vorankommen kann , damit es seine Kinder etwas leichter haben .\n",
      "Daraus ergibt sich auch die Möglichkeit einer positiven Entwicklung der Regionen , denn die Menschen engagieren sich und arbeiten , wenn die Bedingungen dafür geschaffen sind .\n",
      "Abschließend möchte ich darauf hinweisen , daß wir in dieser Beziehung von Amerika lernen sollten , wo Fleiß noch immer in Mode ist und Erfolg einen Beweis für Kompetenz darstellt und nicht Gegenstand von Neid wird , wie das bei uns in Europa der oft Fall ist .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar Barnier , liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen !\n",
      "Da mir nur sehr wenig Zeit zur Verfügung steht , komme ich gleich zur Sache .\n",
      "Zunächst eine Feststellung : Die Früchte des Wachstums sind innerhalb der Union nicht gerecht verteilt .\n",
      "Ein Beispiel sind die Regionen in äußerster Randlage , wo die Arbeitslosigkeit immer noch dramatische Ausmaße aufweist .\n",
      "In Réunion beträgt die Arbeitslosenrate zum Beispiel 37 % .\n",
      "Diese Lage ist nicht konjunkturell , sondern strukturell bedingt .\n",
      "Sie ergibt sich aufgrund unserer Entfernung , unserer Insellage , kurz , unsere Eigenheit schafft diese Situation .\n",
      "Um Abhilfe zu schaffen , ist in Artikel 299 Absatz 2 des Amsterdamer Vertrages das Prinzip einer spezifischen Ausnahmebehandlung vorgesehen worden .\n",
      "Nun gilt es , dieses Prinzip in die Tat umzusetzen .\n",
      "Das für Dezember 1999 angekündigte Papier der Kommission wurde zunächst auf Januar und dann auf Februar verschoben , und die ersten Überlegungen stimmen mich nicht optimistisch .\n",
      "Deshalb appelliere ich an den Rat und die Kommission .\n",
      "Bei der Steuerpolitik , den staatlichen Hilfen , den Strukturfonds , beim Schutz der einheimischen Produktion bedarf es dringend konkreter , kühner und ehrgeiziger Maßnahmen .\n",
      "Denn sonst bleiben Konvergenz und Kohäsion für uns leere Worte , und es steht zu befürchten , daß die in unseren Regionen betriebene Strukturpolitik trotz der hohen eingesetzten Mittel mit einem Mißerfolg endet .\n",
      "Herr Präsident , wie meine Vorredner möchte auch ich Herrn Berend danken und zu dieser ausgezeichneten Arbeit beglückwünschen .\n",
      "Wie beim letzten Mal werden die äußerst kompetente und genaue Analyse , die darin enthaltenen Empfehlungen sowie Ihre Ausführungen , meine Damen und Herren , der Kommission im allgemeinen und dem für Regionalpolitik zuständigen Kommissar im besonderen bei der Programmplanung der Fördermittel für die Jahre 2000-2006 hilfreich sein .\n",
      "Zunächst , Herr Berichterstatter , ein paar Worte zu Ihrer Einschätzung des Sechsten Periodischen Berichts .\n",
      "Sie haben auf die hohe Qualität dieses Berichts verwiesen und haben , wenn ich mich nicht irre , sogar geschrieben , daß dieser im Vergleich zu seinen Vorgängern eine echte Verbesserung darstelle .\n",
      "Im Namen aller Bediensteten der Kommission und meiner Vorgängerin , Frau Wulf-Mathies , möchte ich Ihnen sagen , daß wir diese Beurteilung durch Sie und durch das Parlament gerne zur Kenntnis genommen haben .\n",
      "Es ist richtig , Herr Berend , daß die Kommission besonders bemüht war , in diesem Sechsten Periodischen Bericht die unternommenen Anstrengungen deutlich zu machen und die Analyse der vorgelegten Daten in qualitativer Hinsicht zu verbessern .\n",
      "Ich denke insbesondere an das Kapitel 2.1 des Berichts , in dem die Kommission ausführlich auf die Definition von regionaler Wettbewerbsfähigkeit eingeht und untersucht , inwiefern diese Wettbewerbsfähigkeit durch Faktoren , auf die einige von Ihnen , Herr Markov und Frau Raschhofer , mit Nachdruck verwiesen haben , gefördert , verbessert , beeinflußt werden kann .\n",
      "Ich denke an technologische Forschung und Entwicklung , an Ausstattung und Qualität von Infrastrukturen , an das Potential der Humanressourcen , an die kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen , an ausländische Direktinvestitionen .\n",
      "So viel zur Qualität .\n",
      "Mit den allgemeinen Punkten , denen Ihr Haus bereits zugestimmt hat , möchte ich mich nicht lange aufhalten , Herr Berichterstatter , deshalb kurz im Telegrammstil : Der erste Punkt betrifft die Verwertbarkeit der Schlußfolgerungen dieses Berichts hinsichtlich der Ausarbeitung der Prioritäten der neuen Regionalpolitik , insbesondere im Hinblick auf die Verhandlungen mit den Mitgliedstaaten über die Programmierungsunterlagen .\n",
      "Zweiter Punkt : die Partnerschaft , die vielen von Ihnen sehr wichtig ist , die Rolle der lokalen und regionalen Behörden , des privaten Sektors , der Sozialpartner , der Bürgerinitiativen und der lokalen betreuenden Körperschaften .\n",
      "Ich werde sehr genau darauf achten , ob bezüglich der Partnerschaft die Bestimmungen der allgemeinen Strukturfondsverordnung richtig angewendet werden .\n",
      "Dritter Punkt : Wachstum muß mehr Beschäftigung generieren - auch wenn , wie Herr van Dam vorhin darauf hingewiesen hat , hier vorrangig die Mitgliedstaaten in der Pflicht sind .\n",
      "Wenn wir von der Verantwortung der Mitgliedstaaten , wie auch vom Sinn oder der Effizienz dieser Regionalpolitik sprechen , müssen wir von den derzeit herrschenden Verhältnissen ausgehen .\n",
      "Herr Fruteau sagte vorher , daß die Früchte des Wachstums ungleich verteilt seien .\n",
      "Doch zunächst , Herr Abgeordneter , müssen wir dafür sorgen , daß es überhaupt ein Wachstum gibt und daß wir insgesamt aus der Phase der Stagnation bzw. Rezession herauskommen .\n",
      "Sie werden nun sagen , Wachstum oder Mangel gilt eben nicht für alle .\n",
      "Ich bin mit Ihrer Einschätzung einverstanden : Wenn es Wachstum gibt , muß dieses besser aufgeteilt werden .\n",
      "Doch was noch problematischer ist und was den entfernten Regionen , den Regionen in äußerster Randlage oder Insellage noch mehr schadet , ist die Tatsache , daß es in den letzten beiden Jahrzehnten eben kein Wachstum gegeben hat .\n",
      "Vierter Punkt , auf den Frau Hedkvist Petersen gerade hingewiesen hat : die Förderung einer Politik der Chancengleichheit für Frauen sowie für Jugendliche .\n",
      "Fünfter Punkt : die Bedeutung und Rolle der kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen , auf die Herr Vatanen eben mit aller Deutlichkeit verwiesen hat .\n",
      "Schließlich : die positiven Auswirkungen auf die nationalen Einrichtungen , die für die Verwaltung der Strukturfondsmittel verantwortlich sind , die Motivation der Beamten , die die Mittel verwalten , auch wenn dies manchmal kompliziert ist , und die Bedeutung einer weiteren Verbesserung der Bewertungs- , Betreuungs- und Kontrollsysteme der Kommission .\n",
      "Ich kann dem Europäischen Parlament diesbezüglich mitteilen , daß ich Mitte des Jahres 2000 beabsichtige , mit den nationalen und regionalen Behörden ein Seminar über eben diese Frage der Bewertung der Verfahren für den Austausch von bewährten Praktiken bei der Verwaltung von Strukturfondsmitteln zu veranstalten .\n",
      "Jetzt , Herr Berend , komme ich zu einigen spezifischen Punkten .\n",
      "Sie haben den Wunsch geäußert , daß die Fördergebiete schnell festgelegt werden .\n",
      "Wir sind gerade dabei , die Einteilung abzuschließen .\n",
      "Morgen wird die Kommission über vier weitere Länder entscheiden , und sehr bald , so hoffe ich , wird auch Italien an die Reihe kommen .\n",
      "Hier kommen wir also Ihrem Wunsch nach , denn alle Länder mit Ziel-2-Gebieten werden in Zonen eingeteilt .\n",
      "Was die in Ihrem Bericht angesprochene Schattenwirtschaft anlangt , weiß ich , daß die Analyse und die Erstellung von einschlägigen Statistiken von der Zuverlässigkeit der Daten abhängen , und wie Herr Cocilovo ausführte , besteht hier ein Problem hinsichtlich der Zuverlässigkeit der Daten .\n",
      "Diese werden bei der BIP-Statistik sowie bei Arbeitskräfteerhebungen in gewisser Weise berücksichtigt .\n",
      "Auf jeden Fall möchte ich hervorheben , daß Eurostat bemüht ist - und dies in Zukunft auch sein wird - , die Qualität seiner statistischen Daten zu verbessern .\n",
      "Wie Herr Aparicio Sánchez haben Sie , Herr Berend , bedauert , daß eine Reform des Fischereisektors fehlt .\n",
      "In diesem Zusammenhang möchte ich daran erinnern , daß dieser Sektor , der mich persönlich sehr interessiert , klein ist - was nicht bedeutet , daß er zu vernachlässigen ist - und sich auf nur sehr wenige Regionen konzentriert , was eine Analyse unter regionalen Gesichtspunkten nicht gerade erleichtert .\n",
      "Diese Art der Analyse eines Sektors gehört eher in den Zuständigkeitsbereich der Generaldirektion Fischerei , für die Kollege Fischler verantwortlich zeichnet .\n",
      "Ich möchte Ihnen aber versichern , daß die Kommission bemüht sein wird , eine solche Analyse in den zweiten Kohäsionsbericht aufzunehmen , der mir für derartige Belange der geeignetere Rahmen zu sein scheint .\n",
      "Viele Ihrer Äußerungen , meine Damen und Herren , bezogen sich auf Punkte , die in den zweiten Kohäsionsbericht aufgenommen werden sollen , und Ihr Berichterstatter hat einige dieser Punkte aufgegriffen .\n",
      "Zunächst kann ich Ihnen versichern , daß die Zusammenlegung des Periodischen Berichts und des Kohäsionsberichts zu keinem Verlust an Informationen oder zu einem Nachlassen des Interesses für den Inhalt des Kohäsionsberichts führt , der für mich , Herr Berichterstatter , ein sehr wichtiges Instrument darstellt - nicht nur , um in knapper und transparenter Art darüber zu berichten , was gemacht wurde oder um die zukünftigen Leitlinien zu untersuchen und zu bewerten , sondern auch , um mit den Bürgern , mit ihren gewählten Vertretern , mit Ihnen , eine öffentliche Aussprache über unsere Regionalpolitik und über das , was eines Tages eine europäische Raumordnungspolitik werden könnte , zu führen .\n",
      "Jedenfalls konnte ich feststellen , daß Sie den Wunsch haben , folgende Punkte in den Bericht aufzunehmen : Definition , Erfassung und Analyse von repräsentativen Indikatoren für die Region und alle Länder Mittel ­ und Osteuropas ; ein Kapitel über die Inseln und die Regionen in äußerster Randlage , die Sie mehrfach angesprochen haben , insbesondere Frau Sudre und Herr Fruteau ; Analysen der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Regionen in den Ländern Mittel- und Osteuropas - das ist die große Herausforderung der kommenden Jahre für uns , für Sie , für die Kommission ; schließlich noch grenzüberschreitende Aspekte .\n",
      "Bei all diesen Punkten werde ich bestrebt sein , Ihren Empfehlungen zu folgen .\n",
      "Dann will ich noch einige politische Schlußfolgerungen ansprechen , die Ihnen nicht neu sind , auf deren wichtigste Punkte ich aber dennoch kurz eingehen möchte .\n",
      "Meine Damen und Herren , hinsichtlich einer Annäherung der tatsächlichen Verhältnisse sind bedeutende Fortschritte erzielt worden , insbesondere in den vier Kohäsionsländern , aber auch - und ich sage das ganz offen , Herr Pohjamo - in den Ziel-2-Regionen , wo gewisse Entwicklungsrückstände aufgeholt worden sind , insbesondere im Bereich Infrastruktur .\n",
      "Das ist der erste politische Aspekt .\n",
      "Zweiter politischer Aspekt : Die Strukturfonds erbringen für diesen Annäherungsprozeß einen wichtigen Beitrag und werden diesen auch in Zukunft leisten .\n",
      "Sämtliche makroökonomischen Modelle , mit denen wir arbeiten , zeigen , daß in den letzten zehn Jahren mehr als ein Drittel der in den rückständigen Regionen erreichten Konvergenz ohne die Strukturfonds nicht erreicht worden wäre .\n",
      "Ich nehme aber sehr wohl zur Kenntnis , daß Sie - Frau Sudre , Herr Fruteau oder auch Herr Nogueira Román - insbesondere für die Regionen in äußerster Randlage feststellen , daß - und dies ist mein dritter Aspekt - hinsichtlich einer Verbesserung der Beschäftigungswirksamkeit des Wachstums , der Bekämpfung sozialer Ausgrenzung , die in vielen unserer Regionen unerträgliche Ausmaße angenommen hat , der Integration von Frauen und Jugendlichen in den Arbeitsmarkt noch viel zu tun bleibt .\n",
      "Zum vierten politischen Aspekt , der Erweiterung der Union : das große politische und humanistische Projekt für unsere Institutionen , gleichzeitig die große Herausforderung für eine Kohäsionspolitik in Europa - ein Punkt , auf den auch Herr van Dam hingewiesen hat .\n",
      "Ich glaube , daß sich mit Berlin und mit den uns zur Verfügung stehenden Finanzinstrumenten bereits eine Politik abzeichnet , die sich für die ersten Länder , die zu unserer Gemeinschaft stoßen werden , zu einer Kohäsionspolitik entwickeln könnte .\n",
      "Ich denke hier insbesondere an das strukturpolitische Instrument zur Beitrittsvorbereitung , für dessen Umsetzung in den kommenden Wochen ich verantwortlich zeichnen werde .\n",
      "Meine Damen und Herren , Sie sehen , kaum hat unsere neue Programmierungsphase begonnen , und schon denken wir , Sie und ich gemeinsam , über die Auswirkungen der Erweiterung der Union , über unsere Strukturpolitik nach .\n",
      "Dieser Sechste Periodische Bericht , den Sie , Herr Berend , insgesamt positiv beurteilt haben , ist für uns , für mich , eine gute Grundlage für weitere Überlegungen .\n",
      "Haben Sie vielen herzlichen Dank für Ihren Beitrag zu der laufenden Diskussion über die nächsten Leitlinien sowie über die richtige Anwendung der Leitlinien für die Programme des Zeitraums 2000-2006 .\n",
      "Vielen Dank , Herr Kommissar .\n",
      "Die Aussprache ist geschlossen .\n",
      "Die Abstimmung findet morgen um 12.00 Uhr statt .\n",
      "( Die Sitzung wird um 20.25 Uhr geschlossen . )\n",

      "[\"[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll 1865]\\n\\nCHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole\\n\\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the\\nbook her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in\\nit, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or\\nconversation?'\", 'So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure\\nof making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\nclose by her.', \"There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so\\nVERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!\", 'Oh dear!', \"I shall be late!'\", '(when she thought it over afterwards, it\\noccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time\\nit all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH\\nOUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,\\nAlice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had\\nnever before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch\\nto take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field\\nafter it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large\\nrabbit-hole under the hedge.', 'In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\nin the world she was to get out again.', 'The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep\\nwell.', 'Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was\\ngoing to happen next.', 'First, she tried to look down and make out what\\nshe was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\nhung upon pegs.', \"She took down a jar from one of the shelves as\\nshe passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great\\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\nof killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as\\nshe fell past it.\", \"'Well!'\", \"thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall\\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs!\", \"How brave they'll all think me at\\nhome!\", \"Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top\\nof the house!'\", '(Which was very likely true.)', 'Down, down, down.', 'Would the fall NEVER come to an end!', \"'I wonder how\\nmany miles I've fallen by this time?'\", 'she said aloud.', \"'I must be getting\\nsomewhere near the centre of the earth.\", \"Let me see: that would be four\\nthousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several\\nthings of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this\\nwas not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there\\nwas no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)\\n'--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\\nor Longitude I've got to?'\", '(Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or\\nLongitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)', 'Presently she began again.', \"'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the\\nearth!\", \"How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with\\ntheir heads downward!\", \"The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad\\nthere WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the\\nright word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country\\nis, you know.\", \"Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?'\", \"(and\\nshe tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\\nthrough the air!\", 'Do you think you could manage it?)', \"'And what an\\nignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!\", \"No, it'll never do to\\nask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\", 'Down, down, down.', 'There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\ntalking again.', \"'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'\", '(Dinah was the cat.)', \"'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at\\ntea-time.\", 'Dinah my dear!', 'I wish you were down here with me!', \"There are no\\nmice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very\\nlike a mouse, you know.\", \"But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'\", \"And here Alice\\nbegan to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy\\nsort of way, 'Do cats eat bats?\", \"Do cats eat bats?'\", \"and sometimes, 'Do\\nbats eat cats?'\", \"for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,\\nit didn't much matter which way she put it.\", \"She felt that she was dozing\\noff, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with\\nDinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:\\ndid you ever eat a bat?'\", 'when suddenly, thump!', 'thump!', 'down she came upon\\na heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.', 'Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.', \"There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and\\nwas just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears\\nand whiskers, how late it's getting!'\", 'She was close behind it when she\\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\nfrom the roof.', 'There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\nget out again.', \"Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's\\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\nbut, alas!\", 'either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them.', 'However, on the second\\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!', 'Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\\ninto the loveliest garden you ever saw.', \"How she longed to get out of\\nthat dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\\nthose cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\\ndoorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it\\nwould be of very little use without my shoulders.\", 'Oh, how I wish I could\\nshut up like a telescope!', \"I think I could, if I only know how to begin.'\", 'For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,\\nthat Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really\\nimpossible.', \"There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\\ntime she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here\\nbefore,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\nlabel, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large\\nletters.\", \"It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was\\nnot going to do THAT in a hurry.\", '\\'No, I\\'ll look first,\\' she said, \\'and\\nsee whether it\\'s marked \"poison\" or not\\'; for she had read several nice\\nlittle histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild\\nbeasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember\\nthe simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot\\npoker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never\\nforgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \\'poison,\\' it is\\nalmost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.', \"However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste\\nit, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour\\nof cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot\\nbuttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\", \"*    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n'What a curious feeling!'\", \"said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a\\ntelescope.'\", 'And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden.', \"First, however, she\\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\\nshe felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said\\nAlice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle.\", \"I wonder\\nwhat I should be like then?'\", 'And she tried to fancy what the flame of a\\ncandle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\\never having seen such a thing.', 'After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!', 'when she got to the\\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\nsat down and cried.', \"'Come, there's no use in crying like that!'\", \"said Alice to herself,\\nrather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!'\", 'She generally\\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.', \"'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!\", \"Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'\", \"Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\\n'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\", \"'Well, I'll eat it,' said\\nAlice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll\\nget into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'\", \"She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way?\", 'Which\\nway?', \"', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on\\nin the common way.\", 'So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.', '*    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.', \"The Pool of Tears\\n\\n'Curiouser and curiouser!'\", \"cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm\\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was!\", \"Good-bye, feet!'\", '(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\\nsight, they were getting so far off).', \"'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder\\nwho will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?\", \"I'm sure\\n_I_ shan't be able!\", \"I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be\\nkind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want\\nto go!\", \"Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'\", 'And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.', \"'They must\\ngo by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending\\npresents to one's own feet!\", 'And how odd the directions will look!', \"ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\", \"HEARTHRUG,\\n         NEAR THE FENDER,\\n           (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).\", \"Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'\", 'Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.', 'Poor Alice!', 'It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.', \"'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like\\nyou,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way!\", \"Stop this\\nmoment, I tell you!'\", 'But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of\\ntears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches\\ndeep and reaching half down the hall.', 'After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.', \"It was the White\\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in\\none hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great\\nhurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh!\", 'the Duchess, the Duchess!', 'Oh!', \"won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!'\", \"Alice felt so\\ndesperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--'\\nThe Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,\\nand skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\", \"Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear!\", 'How\\nqueer everything is to-day!', 'And yesterday things went on just as usual.', \"I wonder if I've been changed in the night?\", 'Let me think: was I the\\nsame when I got up this morning?', 'I almost think I can remember feeling a\\nlittle different.', \"But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who\\nin the world am I?\", \"Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'\", 'And she began thinking\\nover all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to\\nsee if she could have been changed for any of them.', \"'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long\\nringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all;

and while she was peering about anxiously among\\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\\ngreat hurry.', 'An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.', \"'Poor little thing!'\", 'said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it;

whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.', \"This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;

said Alice.\", \"'Why?'\", \"'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.'\", 'the Gryphon replied very solemnly.', 'Alice was thoroughly puzzled.', \"'Does the boots and shoes!'\", 'she repeated\\nin a wondering tone.', \"'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?'\", 'said the Gryphon.', \"'I mean, what\\nmakes them so shiny?'\", 'Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\\nanswer.', \"'They're done with blacking, I believe.'\", \"'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\\n'are done with a whiting.\", \"Now you know.'\", \"'And what are they made of?'\", 'Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.', \"'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\\n'any shrimp could have told you that.'\", '\\'If I\\'d been the whiting,\\' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running\\non the song, \\'I\\'d have said to the porpoise, \"Keep back, please: we\\ndon\\'t want YOU with us!\"\\'', \"'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'no\\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'\", \"'Wouldn't it really?'\", 'said Alice in a tone of great surprise.', '\\'Of course not,\\' said the Mock Turtle: \\'why, if a fish came to ME, and\\ntold me he was going a journey, I should say \"With what porpoise?\"\\'', '\\'Don\\'t you mean \"purpose\"?\\'', 'said Alice.', \"'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.\", \"And\\nthe Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.'\", \"'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said\\nAlice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday,\\nbecause I was a different person then.'\", \"'Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.\", \"'No, no!\", \"The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\\n'explanations take such a dreadful time.'\", 'So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\\nsaw the White Rabbit.', 'She was a little nervous about it just at first,\\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\\ntheir eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went\\non.', \"Her listeners

up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\\nvery queer indeed:--\\n\\n  \\'\\'Tis the voice of the

the Tarts?', 'The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little\\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,\\nand a scroll of parchment in the other.', \"In the very middle of the court\\nwas a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,\\nthat it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the\\ntrial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!'\", 'But there\\nseemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about\\nher, to pass away the time.', 'Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\\nthe name of nearly everything there.', \"'That's the judge,' she said to\\nherself, 'because of his great wig.'\", 'The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did\\nnot look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.', \"'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'\\n(she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of

too, that very few little girls of her\\nage knew the meaning of it at all.', \"However, 'jury-men' would have done\\njust as well.\", 'The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.',

not make out\\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was\\nobliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was\\nof very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.', \"'Herald, read the accusation!'\", 'said the King.', \"On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as

said the March Hare.\", \"'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.\", \"'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up,

jury, who instantly made a\\nmemorandum of the fact.', \"'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of\\nmy own.\", \"I'm a hatter.'\", 'Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.', \"'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have\\nyou executed on the spot.'\", 'This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in\\nhis confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\\nbread-and-butter.', 'Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as\\nlong as there was room for her.', \"'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.'\", 'said the Dormouse, who was sitting\\nnext to her.', \"'I can hardly breathe.'\", \"'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'\", \"'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.\", \"'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing\\ntoo.'\", \"'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that\\nridiculous fashion.'\", 'And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\\nother side of the court.', \"All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\\nof the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!'\", 'on\\nwhich the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.', \"'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you\\nexecuted, whether you're nervous or not.'\", \"'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\\n'--and I hadn't begun my tea--not

replied.\", \"'Of course twinkling begins with a T!'\", 'said the King sharply.', \"'Do you\\ntake me for a dunce?\", \"Go on!'\", \"'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after\\nthat--only the March Hare said--'\\n\\n'I didn't!'\", 'the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.', \"'You did!'\", 'said the Hatter.', \"'I deny it!'\", 'said the March Hare.', \"'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'\", \"'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking\\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\\nnothing, being fast asleep.\", \"'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'\\n\\n'But what did the Dormouse say?'\", 'one of the jury asked.', \"'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.\", \"'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'\", 'The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\\ndown on one knee.', \"'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.\", \"'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.\", 'Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\\nthe officers of the court.', '(As that is rather a hard word, I will just\\nexplain to you how it was done.', 'They had a large canvas bag, which tied\\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)', \"'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.\", '\\'I\\'ve so often read\\nin the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some attempts\\nat applause, which

the\\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\\nto the door.\", \"'Call the next witness!'\", 'said the King.', \"The next witness was the Duchess's cook.\", 'She carried the pepper-box in\\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.', \"'Give your evidence,' said the King.\", \"'Shan't,' said the cook.\", \"The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\\n'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'\", \"'Well, if I must, I must,'

cook had\\ndisappeared.', \"'Never mind!'\", 'said the King, with an air of great relief.', \"'Call the next\\nwitness.'\", \"And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear,\\nYOU must cross-examine the next witness.\", \"It quite makes my forehead\\nache!'\", \"Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very\\ncurious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't\\ngot much evidence YET,' she said to herself.\", \"Imagine her surprise, when\\nthe White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the\\nname 'Alice!'\", \"CHAPTER XII\\n\\n           Alice's Evidence\\n\\n\\n'Here!'\", 'cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish\\nshe had accidentally upset the week before.', \"'Oh, I BEG your pardon!'\", 'she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of\\nthe goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea\\nthat they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or\\nthey would die.', \"'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until\\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with\\ngreat emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.\",

move.', \"She soon got\\nit out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said\\nto herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial\\none way up as the other.'\", 'As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\\ncourt.', \"'What do you know about this

by--the\\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she\\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby\\nwas sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed\\naround it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\\nLizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\\nTurtle.\", \"So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\\nwould change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the\\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling\\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill\\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the\\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she\\nknew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing\\nof the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's\\nheavy sobs.\", 'Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and\\nmake THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even\\nwith the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with\\nall their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\\nremembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.']\n"

thou from the first \\nWast present, and, with mighty wings outspread, \\nDove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss, \\nAnd mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark \\nIllumine, what is low raise and support; \\nThat, to the height of this great argument, \\nI may assert Eternal Providence, \\nAnd justify the ways of God to men.\", 'Say first--for Heaven hides nothing from thy view, \\nNor the deep tract of Hell--say first what cause \\nMoved our grand parents, in that happy state, \\nFavoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off \\nFrom their Creator, and transgress his will \\nFor one restraint, lords of the World besides.', 'Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?', \"Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile, \\nStirred up with envy and revenge, deceived \\nThe mother of mankind, what time his pride \\nHad cast him out from Heaven, with all his host \\nOf rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring \\nTo set himself in glory above his peers, \\nHe trusted to have equalled the Most High, \\nIf he opposed, and with ambitious aim \\nAgainst the throne and monarchy of God, \\nRaised impious war in Heaven and battle proud, \\nWith vain attempt.\", \"Him the Almighty Power \\nHurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky, \\nWith hideous ruin and combustion, down \\nTo bottomless perdition, there to dwell \\nIn adamantine chains and penal fire, \\nWho durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms.\", 'Nine times the space that measures day and night \\nTo mortal men, he, with his horrid crew, \\nLay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf, \\nConfounded, though immortal.', 'But his doom \\nReserved him to more wrath; for now the thought \\nBoth of lost happiness and lasting pain \\nTorments him: round he throws his baleful eyes, \\nThat witnessed huge affliction and dismay, \\nMixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.', 'At once, as far as Angels ken, he views \\nThe dismal situation waste and wild.', 'A dungeon horrible, on all sides round, \\nAs one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames \\nNo light; but rather darkness visible \\nServed only to discover sights of woe, \\nRegions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace \\nAnd rest can never dwell, hope never comes \\nThat comes to all, but torture without end \\nStill urges, and a fiery deluge, fed \\nWith ever-burning sulphur unconsumed.', \"Such place Eternal Justice has prepared \\nFor those rebellious; here their prison ordained \\nIn utter darkness, and their portion set, \\nAs far removed from God and light of Heaven \\nAs from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole.\", 'Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!', \"There the companions of his fall, o'erwhelmed \\nWith floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, \\nHe soon discerns; and, weltering by his side, \\nOne next himself in power, and next in crime, \\nLong after known in Palestine, and named \\nBeelzebub.\", 'To whom th\\' Arch-Enemy, \\nAnd thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words \\nBreaking the horrid silence, thus began:-- \\n  \"If thou beest he--but O how fallen!', 'how changed \\nFrom him who, in the happy realms of light \\nClothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine \\nMyriads, though bright!--if he whom mutual league, \\nUnited thoughts and counsels, equal hope \\nAnd hazard in the glorious enterprise \\nJoined with me once, now misery hath joined \\nIn equal ruin; into what pit thou seest \\nFrom what height fallen: so much the stronger proved \\nHe with his thunder; and till then who knew \\nThe force of those dire arms?', 'Yet not for those, \\nNor what the potent Victor in his rage \\nCan else inflict, do I repent, or change, \\nThough changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind, \\nAnd high disdain from sense of injured merit, \\nThat with the Mightiest raised me to contend, \\nAnd to the fierce contentions brought along \\nInnumerable force of Spirits armed, \\nThat durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring, \\nHis utmost power with adverse power opposed \\nIn dubious battle on the plains of Heaven, \\nAnd shook his throne.', 'What though the field be lost?', 'All is not lost--the unconquerable will, \\nAnd study of revenge, immortal hate, \\nAnd courage never to submit or yield: \\nAnd what is else not to be overcome?', 'That glory never shall his wrath or might \\nExtort from me.', 'To bow and sue for grace \\nWith suppliant knee, and deify his power \\nWho, from the terror of this arm, so late \\nDoubted his empire--that were low indeed; \\nThat were an ignominy and shame beneath \\nThis downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods, \\nAnd this empyreal sybstance, cannot fail; \\nSince, through experience of this great event, \\nIn arms not worse, in foresight much advanced, \\nWe may with more successful hope resolve \\nTo wage by force or guile eternal war, \\nIrreconcilable to our grand Foe, \\nWho now triumphs, and in th\\' excess of joy \\nSole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven.\"', 'So spake th\\' apostate Angel, though in pain, \\nVaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair; \\nAnd him thus answered soon his bold compeer:-- \\n  \"O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers \\nThat led th\\' embattled Seraphim to war \\nUnder thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds \\nFearless, endangered Heaven\\'s perpetual King, \\nAnd put to proof his high supremacy, \\nWhether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate, \\nToo well I see and rue the dire event \\nThat, with sad overthrow and foul defeat, \\nHath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host \\nIn horrible destruction laid thus low, \\nAs far as Gods and heavenly Essences \\nCan perish: for the mind and spirit remains \\nInvincible, and vigour soon returns, \\nThough all our glory extinct, and happy state \\nHere swallowed up in endless misery.', \"But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now \\nOf force believe almighty, since no less \\nThan such could have o'erpowered such force as ours) \\nHave left us this our spirit and strength entire, \\nStrongly to suffer and support our pains, \\nThat we may so suffice his vengeful ire, \\nOr do him mightier service as his thralls \\nBy right of war, whate'er his business be, \\nHere in the heart of Hell to work in fire, \\nOr do his errands in the gloomy Deep?\", 'What can it the avail though yet we feel \\nStrength undiminished, or eternal being \\nTo undergo eternal punishment?\"', 'Whereto with speedy words th\\' Arch-Fiend replied:-- \\n\"Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable, \\nDoing or suffering: but of this be sure-- \\nTo do aught good never will be our task, \\nBut ever to do ill our sole delight, \\nAs being the contrary to his high will \\nWhom we resist.', 'If then his providence \\nOut of our evil seek to bring forth good, \\nOur labour must be to pervert that end, \\nAnd out of good still to find means of evil; \\nWhich ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps \\nShall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb \\nHis inmost counsels from their destined aim.', 'But see!', \"the angry Victor hath recalled \\nHis ministers of vengeance and pursuit \\nBack to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail, \\nShot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid \\nThe fiery surge that from the precipice \\nOf Heaven received us falling; and the thunder, \\nWinged with red lightning and impetuous rage, \\nPerhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now \\nTo bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.\", \"Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn \\nOr satiate fury yield it from our Foe.\", 'Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild, \\nThe seat of desolation, void of light, \\nSave what the glimmering of these livid flames \\nCasts pale and dreadful?', 'Thither let us tend \\nFrom off the tossing of these fiery waves; \\nThere rest, if any rest can harbour there; \\nAnd, re-assembling our afflicted powers, \\nConsult how we may henceforth most offend \\nOur enemy, our own loss how repair, \\nHow overcome this dire calamity, \\nWhat reinforcement we may gain from hope, \\nIf not, what resolution from despair.\"', \"Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate, \\nWith head uplift above the wave, and eyes \\nThat sparkling blazed; his other parts besides \\nProne on the flood, extended long and large, \\nLay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge \\nAs whom the fables name of monstrous size, \\nTitanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove, \\nBriareos or Typhon, whom the den \\nBy ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast \\nLeviathan, which God of all his works \\nCreated hugest that swim th' ocean-stream.\", 'Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam, \\nThe pilot of some small night-foundered skiff, \\nDeeming some island, oft, as seamen tell, \\nWith fixed anchor in his scaly rind, \\nMoors by his side under the lee, while night \\nInvests the sea, and wished morn delays.', 'So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay, \\nChained on the burning lake; nor ever thence \\nHad risen, or heaved his head, but that the will \\nAnd high permission of all-ruling Heaven \\nLeft him at large to his own dark designs, \\nThat with reiterated crimes he might \\nHeap on himself damnation, while he sought \\nEvil to others, and enraged might see \\nHow all his malice served but to bring forth \\nInfinite goodness, grace, and mercy, shewn \\nOn Man by him seduced, but on himself \\nTreble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured.', \"Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool \\nHis mighty stature; on each hand the flames \\nDriven backward slope their pointing spires, and,rolled \\nIn billows, leave i' th' midst a horrid vale.\", 'Then with expanded wings he steers his flight \\nAloft, incumbent on the dusky air, \\nThat felt unusual weight; till on dry land \\nHe lights--if it were land that ever burned \\nWith solid, as the lake with liquid fire, \\nAnd such appeared in hue as when the force \\nOf subterranean wind transprots a hill \\nTorn from Pelorus, or the shattered side \\nOf thundering Etna, whose combustible \\nAnd fuelled entrails, thence conceiving fire, \\nSublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds, \\nAnd leave a singed bottom all involved \\nWith stench and smoke.', 'Such resting found the sole \\nOf unblest feet.', 'Him followed his next mate; \\nBoth glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood \\nAs gods, and by their own recovered strength, \\nNot by the sufferance of supernal Power.', '\"Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,\" \\nSaid then the lost Archangel, \"this the seat \\nThat we must change for Heaven?--this mournful gloom \\nFor that celestial light?', 'Be it so, since he \\nWho now is sovereign can dispose and bid \\nWhat shall be right: farthest from him is best \\nWhom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme \\nAbove his equals.', 'Farewell, happy fields, \\nWhere joy for ever dwells!', 'Hail, horrors!', 'hail, \\nInfernal world!', 'and thou, profoundest Hell, \\nReceive thy new possessor--one who brings \\nA mind not to be changed by place or time.', 'The mind is its own place, and in itself \\nCan make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.', 'What matter where, if I be still the same, \\nAnd what I should be, all but less than he \\nWhom thunder hath made greater?', \"Here at least \\nWe shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built \\nHere for his envy, will not drive us hence: \\nHere we may reigh secure; and, in my choice, \\nTo reign is worth ambition, though in Hell: \\nBetter to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.\", 'But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, \\nTh\\' associates and co-partners of our loss, \\nLie thus astonished on th\\' oblivious pool, \\nAnd call them not to share with us their part \\nIn this unhappy mansion, or once more \\nWith rallied arms to try what may be yet \\nRegained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell?\"', 'So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub \\nThus answered:--\"Leader of those armies bright \\nWhich, but th\\' Omnipotent, none could have foiled!', 'If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge \\nOf hope in fears and dangers--heard so oft \\nIn worst extremes, and on the perilous edge \\nOf battle, when it raged, in all assaults \\nTheir surest signal--they will soon resume \\nNew courage and revive, though now they lie \\nGrovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire, \\nAs we erewhile, astounded and amazed; \\nNo wonder, fallen such a pernicious height!\"', 'He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend \\nWas moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield, \\nEthereal temper, massy, large, and round, \\nBehind him cast.', 'The broad circumference \\nHung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb \\nThrough optic glass the Tuscan artist views \\nAt evening, from the top of Fesole, \\nOr in Valdarno, to descry new lands, \\nRivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.', \"His spear--to equal which the tallest pine \\nHewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast \\nOf some great ammiral, were but a wand-- \\nHe walked with, to support uneasy steps \\nOver the burning marl, not like those steps \\nOn Heaven's azure; and the torrid clime \\nSmote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire.\", \"Nathless he so endured, till on the beach \\nOf that inflamed sea he stood, and called \\nHis legions--Angel Forms, who lay entranced \\nThick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks \\nIn Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades \\nHigh over-arched embower; or scattered sedge \\nAfloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed \\nHath vexed the Red-Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew \\nBusiris and his Memphian chivalry, \\nWhile with perfidious hatred they pursued \\nThe sojourners of Goshen, who beheld \\nFrom the safe shore their floating carcases \\nAnd broken chariot-wheels.\", 'So thick bestrown, \\nAbject and lost, lay these, covering the flood, \\nUnder amazement of their hideous change.', 'He called so loud that all the hollow deep \\nOf Hell resounded:--\"Princes, Potentates, \\nWarriors, the Flower of Heaven--once yours; now lost, \\nIf such astonishment as this can seize \\nEternal Spirits!', 'Or have ye chosen this place \\nAfter the toil of battle to repose \\nYour wearied virtue, for the ease you find \\nTo slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven?', \"Or in this abject posture have ye sworn \\nTo adore the Conqueror, who now beholds \\nCherub and Seraph rolling in the flood \\nWith scattered arms and ensigns, till anon \\nHis swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern \\nTh' advantage, and, descending, tread us down \\nThus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts \\nTransfix us to the bottom of this gulf?\", 'Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!\"', 'They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung \\nUpon the wing, as when men wont to watch \\nOn duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, \\nRouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.', \"Nor did they not perceive the evil plight \\nIn which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;

how many battles fought \\nHow many kings destroyed; and kingdoms won; \\nOr how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still \\nA day entire, and night's due course adjourn, \\nMan's voice commanding, 'Sun, in Gibeon stand, \\n'And thou moon in the vale of Aialon, \\n'Till Israel overcome!\", 'so call the third \\nFrom Abraham, son of Isaac; and from him \\nHis whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.', 'Here Adam interposed.', 'O sent from Heaven, \\nEnlightener of my darkness, gracious things \\nThou hast revealed; those chiefly, which concern \\nJust Abraham and his seed: now first I find \\nMine eyes true-opening, and my heart much eased; \\nErewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become \\nOf me and all mankind:  But now I see \\nHis day, in whom all nations shall be blest; \\nFavour unmerited by me, who sought \\nForbidden knowledge by forbidden means.', 'This yet I apprehend not, why to those \\nAmong whom God will deign to dwell on earth \\nSo many and so various laws are given; \\nSo many laws argue so many sins \\nAmong them; how can God with such reside?', 'To whom thus Michael.', 'Doubt not but that sin \\nWill reign among them, as of thee begot; \\nAnd therefore was law given them, to evince \\nTheir natural pravity, by stirring up \\nSin against law to fight: that when they see \\nLaw can discover sin, but not remove, \\nSave by those shadowy expiations weak, \\nThe blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude \\nSome blood more precious must be paid for Man; \\nJust for unjust; that, in such righteousness \\nTo them by faith imputed, they may find \\nJustification towards God, and peace \\nOf conscience; which the law by ceremonies \\nCannot appease; nor Man the mortal part \\nPerform; and, not performing, cannot live.', 'So law appears imperfect; and but given \\nWith purpose to resign them, in full time, \\nUp to a better covenant; disciplined \\nFrom shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit; \\nFrom imposition of strict laws to free \\nAcceptance of large grace; from servile fear \\nTo filial; works of law to works of faith.', \"And therefore shall not Moses, though of God \\nHighly beloved, being but the minister \\nOf law, his people into Canaan lead; \\nBut Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call, \\nHis name and office bearing, who shall quell \\nThe adversary-Serpent, and bring back \\nThrough the world's wilderness long-wandered Man \\nSafe to eternal Paradise of rest.\", \"Mean while they, in their earthly Canaan placed, \\nLong time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins \\nNational interrupt their publick peace, \\nProvoking God to raise them enemies; \\nFrom whom as oft he saves them penitent \\nBy Judges first, then under Kings; of whom \\nThe second, both for piety renowned \\nAnd puissant deeds, a promise shall receive \\nIrrevocable, that his regal throne \\nFor ever shall endure; the like shall sing \\nAll Prophecy, that of the royal stock \\nOf David (so I name this king) shall rise \\nA Son, the Woman's seed to thee foretold, \\nForetold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust \\nAll nations; and to kings foretold, of kings \\nThe last; for of his reign shall be no end.\", 'But first, a long succession must ensue; \\nAnd his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed, \\nThe clouded ark of God, till then in tents \\nWandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine.', 'Such follow him, as shall be registered \\nPart good, part bad; of bad the longer scroll; \\nWhose foul idolatries, and other faults \\nHeaped to the popular sum, will so incense \\nGod, as to leave them, and expose their land, \\nTheir city, his temple, and his holy ark, \\nWith all his sacred things, a scorn and prey \\nTo that proud city, whose high walls thou sawest \\nLeft in confusion; Babylon thence called.', 'There in captivity he lets them dwell \\nThe space of seventy years; then brings them back, \\nRemembering mercy, and his covenant sworn \\nTo David, stablished as the days of Heaven.', \"Returned from Babylon by leave of kings \\nTheir lords, whom God disposed, the house of God \\nThey first re-edify; and for a while \\nIn mean estate live moderate; till, grown \\nIn wealth and multitude, factious they grow; \\nBut first among the priests dissention springs, \\nMen who attend the altar, and should most \\nEndeavour peace: their strife pollution brings \\nUpon the temple itself: at last they seise \\nThe scepter, and regard not David's sons; \\nThen lose it to a stranger, that the true \\nAnointed King Messiah might be born \\nBarred of his right; yet at his birth a star, \\nUnseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come; \\nAnd guides the eastern sages, who inquire \\nHis place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold: \\nHis place of birth a solemn Angel tells \\nTo simple shepherds, keeping watch by night; \\nThey gladly thither haste, and by a quire \\nOf squadroned Angels hear his carol sung.\", \"A virgin is his mother, but his sire \\nThe power of the Most High:  He shall ascend \\nThe throne hereditary, and bound his reign \\nWith Earth's wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens.\", 'He ceased, discerning Adam with such joy \\nSurcharged, as had like grief been dewed in tears, \\nWithout the vent of words; which these he breathed.', 'O prophet of glad tidings, finisher \\nOf utmost hope!', 'now clear I understand \\nWhat oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain; \\nWhy our great Expectation should be called \\nThe seed of Woman:  Virgin Mother, hail, \\nHigh in the love of Heaven; yet from my loins \\nThou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the Son \\nOf God Most High: so God with Man unites!', \"Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise \\nExpect with mortal pain:  Say where and when \\nTheir fight, what stroke shall bruise the victor's heel.\", 'To whom thus Michael.', \"Dream not of their fight, \\nAs of a duel, or the local wounds \\nOf head or heel:  Not therefore joins the Son \\nManhood to Godhead, with more strength to foil \\nThy enemy; nor so is overcome \\nSatan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise, \\nDisabled, not to give thee thy death's wound: \\nWhich he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure, \\nNot by destroying Satan, but his works \\nIn thee, and in thy seed:  Nor can this be, \\nBut by fulfilling that which thou didst want, \\nObedience to the law of God, imposed \\nOn penalty of death, and suffering death; \\nThe penalty to thy transgression due, \\nAnd due to theirs which out of thine will grow: \\nSo only can high Justice rest appaid.\", 'The law of God exact he shall fulfil \\nBoth by obedience and by love, though love \\nAlone fulfil the law; thy punishment \\nHe shall endure, by coming in the flesh \\nTo a reproachful life, and cursed death; \\nProclaiming life to all who shall believe \\nIn his redemption; and that his obedience, \\nImputed, becomes theirs by faith; his merits \\nTo save them, not their own, though legal, works.', \"For this he shall live hated, be blasphemed, \\nSeised on by force, judged, and to death condemned \\nA shameful and accursed, nailed to the cross \\nBy his own nation; slain for bringing life: \\nBut to the cross he nails thy enemies, \\nThe law that is against thee, and the sins \\nOf all mankind, with him there crucified, \\nNever to hurt them more who rightly trust \\nIn this his satisfaction; so he dies, \\nBut soon revives; Death over him no power \\nShall long usurp; ere the third dawning light \\nReturn, the stars of morn shall see him rise \\nOut of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, \\nThy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, \\nHis death for Man, as many as offered life \\nNeglect not, and the benefit embrace \\nBy faith not void of works:  This God-like act \\nAnnuls thy doom, the death thou shouldest have died, \\nIn sin for ever lost from life; this act \\nShall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength, \\nDefeating Sin and Death, his two main arms; \\nAnd fix far deeper in his head their stings \\nThan temporal death shall bruise the victor's heel, \\nOr theirs whom he redeems; a death, like sleep, \\nA gentle wafting to immortal life.\", 'Nor after resurrection shall he stay \\nLonger on earth, than certain times to appear \\nTo his disciples, men who in his life \\nStill followed him; to them shall leave in charge \\nTo teach all nations what of him they learned \\nAnd his salvation; them who shall believe \\nBaptizing in the profluent stream, the sign \\nOf washing them from guilt of sin to life \\nPure, and in mind prepared, if so befall, \\nFor death, like that which the Redeemer died.', \"All nations they shall teach; for, from that day, \\nNot only to the sons of Abraham's loins \\nSalvation shall be preached, but to the sons \\nOf Abraham's faith wherever through the world; \\nSo in his seed all nations shall be blest.\", \"Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend \\nWith victory, triumphing through the air \\nOver his foes and thine; there shall surprise \\nThe Serpent, prince of air, and drag in chains \\nThrough all his realm, and there confounded leave; \\nThen enter into glory, and resume \\nHis seat at God's right hand, exalted high \\nAbove all names in Heaven; and thence shall come, \\nWhen this world's dissolution shall be ripe, \\nWith glory and power to judge both quick and dead; \\nTo judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward \\nHis faithful, and receive them into bliss, \\nWhether in Heaven or Earth; for then the Earth \\nShall all be Paradise, far happier place \\nThan this of Eden, and far happier days.\", \"So spake the Arch-Angel Michael; then paused, \\nAs at the world's great period; and our sire, \\nReplete with joy and wonder, thus replied.\", 'O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense!', 'That all this good of evil shall produce, \\nAnd evil turn to good; more wonderful \\nThan that which by creation first brought forth \\nLight out of darkness!', 'Full of doubt I stand, \\nWhether I should repent me now of sin \\nBy me done, and occasioned; or rejoice \\nMuch more, that much more good thereof shall spring; \\nTo God more glory, more good-will to Men \\nFrom God, and over wrath grace shall abound.', 'But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven \\nMust re-ascend, what will betide the few \\nHis faithful, left among the unfaithful herd, \\nThe enemies of truth?', 'Who then shall guide \\nHis people, who defend?', 'Will they not deal \\nWorse with his followers than with him they dealt?', \"Be sure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven \\nHe to his own a Comforter will send, \\nThe promise of the Father, who shall dwell \\nHis Spirit within them; and the law of faith, \\nWorking through love, upon their hearts shall write, \\nTo guide them in all truth; and also arm \\nWith spiritual armour, able to resist \\nSatan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts; \\nWhat man can do against them, not afraid, \\nThough to the death; against such cruelties \\nWith inward consolations recompensed, \\nAnd oft supported so as shall amaze \\nTheir proudest persecutors:  For the Spirit, \\nPoured first on his Apostles, whom he sends \\nTo evangelize the nations, then on all \\nBaptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue \\nTo speak all tongues, and do all miracles, \\nAs did their Lord before them.\", 'Thus they win \\nGreat numbers of each nation to receive \\nWith joy the tidings brought from Heaven:  At length \\nTheir ministry performed, and race well run, \\nTheir doctrine and their story written left, \\nThey die; but in their room, as they forewarn, \\nWolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves, \\nWho all the sacred mysteries of Heaven \\nTo their own vile advantages shall turn \\nOf lucre and ambition; and the truth \\nWith superstitions and traditions taint, \\nLeft only in those written records pure, \\nThough not but by the Spirit understood.', 'Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, \\nPlaces, and titles, and with these to join \\nSecular power; though feigning still to act \\nBy spiritual, to themselves appropriating \\nThe Spirit of God, promised alike and given \\nTo all believers; and, from that pretence, \\nSpiritual laws by carnal power shall force \\nOn every conscience; laws which none shall find \\nLeft them inrolled, or what the Spirit within \\nShall on the heart engrave.', 'What will they then \\nBut force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind \\nHis consort Liberty?', \"what, but unbuild \\nHis living temples, built by faith to stand, \\nTheir own faith, not another's?\", 'for, on earth, \\nWho against faith and conscience can be heard \\nInfallible?', \"yet many will presume: \\nWhence heavy persecution shall arise \\nOn all, who in the worship persevere \\nOf spirit and truth; the rest, far greater part, \\nWill deem in outward rites and specious forms \\nReligion satisfied; Truth shall retire \\nBestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith \\nRarely be found:  So shall the world go on, \\nTo good malignant, to bad men benign; \\nUnder her own weight groaning; till the day \\nAppear of respiration to the just, \\nAnd vengeance to the wicked, at return \\nOf him so lately promised to thy aid, \\nThe Woman's Seed; obscurely then foretold, \\nNow ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord; \\nLast, in the clouds, from Heaven to be revealed \\nIn glory of the Father, to dissolve \\nSatan with his perverted world; then raise \\nFrom the conflagrant mass, purged and refined, \\nNew Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date, \\nFounded in righteousness, and peace, and love; \\nTo bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss.\", 'He ended; and thus Adam last replied.', 'How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, \\nMeasured this transient world, the race of time, \\nTill time stand fixed!', 'Beyond is all abyss, \\nEternity, whose end no eye can reach.', 'Greatly-instructed I shall hence depart; \\nGreatly in peace of thought; and have my fill \\nOf knowledge, what this vessel can contain; \\nBeyond which was my folly to aspire.', \"Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best, \\nAnd love with fear the only God; to walk \\nAs in his presence; ever to observe \\nHis providence; and on him sole depend, \\nMerciful over all his works, with good \\nStill overcoming evil, and by small \\nAccomplishing great things, by things deemed weak \\nSubverting worldly strong, and worldly wise \\nBy simply meek: that suffering for truth's sake \\nIs fortitude to highest victory, \\nAnd, to the faithful, death the gate of life; \\nTaught this by his example, whom I now \\nAcknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.\", 'To whom thus also the Angel last replied.', \"This having learned, thou hast attained the sum \\nOf wisdom; hope no higher, though all the stars \\nThou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers, \\nAll secrets of the deep, all Nature's works, \\nOr works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea, \\nAnd all the riches of this world enjoyedst, \\nAnd all the rule, one empire; only add \\nDeeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith, \\nAdd virtue, patience, temperance; add love, \\nBy name to come called charity, the soul \\nOf all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth \\nTo leave this Paradise, but shalt possess \\nA Paradise within thee, happier far.-- \\nLet us descend now therefore from this top \\nOf speculation; for the hour precise \\nExacts our parting hence; and see!the guards, \\nBy me encamped on yonder hill, expect \\nTheir motion; at whose front a flaming sword, \\nIn signal of remove, waves fiercely round: \\nWe may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; \\nHer also I with gentle dreams have calmed \\nPortending good, and all her spirits composed \\nTo meek submission: thou, at season fit, \\nLet her with thee partake what thou hast heard; \\nChiefly what may concern her faith to know, \\nThe great deliverance by her seed to come \\n(For by the Woman's seed) on all mankind: \\nThat ye may live, which will be many days, \\nBoth in one faith unanimous, though sad, \\nWith cause, for evils past; yet much more cheered \\nWith meditation on the happy end.\", 'He ended, and they both descend the hill; \\nDescended, Adam to the bower, where Eve \\nLay sleeping, ran before; but found her waked; \\nAnd thus with words not sad she him received.', \"Whence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know; \\nFor God is also in sleep; and dreams advise, \\nWhich he hath sent propitious, some great good \\nPresaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress \\nWearied I fell asleep:  But now lead on; \\nIn me is no delay; with thee to go, \\nIs to stay here; without thee here to stay, \\nIs to go hence unwilling; thou to me \\nArt all things under $Heaven, all places thou, \\nWho for my wilful crime art banished hence.\", 'This further consolation yet secure \\nI carry hence; though all by me is lost, \\nSuch favour I unworthy am vouchsafed, \\nBy me the Promised Seed shall all restore.', \"So spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard \\nWell pleased, but answered not:  For now, too nigh \\nThe Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill \\nTo their fixed station, all in bright array \\nThe Cherubim descended; on the ground \\nGliding meteorous, as evening-mist \\nRisen from a river o'er the marish glides, \\nAnd gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel \\nHomeward returning.\", 'High in front advanced, \\nThe brandished sword of God before them blazed, \\nFierce as a comet; which with torrid heat, \\nAnd vapour as the Libyan air adust, \\nBegan to parch that temperate clime; whereat \\nIn either hand the hastening Angel caught \\nOur lingering parents, and to the eastern gate \\nLed them direct, and down the cliff as fast \\nTo the subjected plain; then disappeared.', 'They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld \\nOf Paradise, so late their happy seat, \\nWaved over by that flaming brand; the gate \\nWith dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms: \\nSome natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon; \\nThe world was all before them, where to choose \\nTheir place of rest, and Providence their guide: \\nThey, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, \\nThrough Eden took their solitary way.', '[The End]\\x1a\\x1a']\n"

       " 'So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure\\nof making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\nclose by her.',\n",
       " \"There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so\\nVERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!\",\n",

       " 'In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\nin the world she was to get out again.',\n",
       " 'The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep\\nwell.',\n",
       " 'Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was\\ngoing to happen next.',\n",

       " \"She took down a jar from one of the shelves as\\nshe passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great\\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\nof killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as\\nshe fell past it.\",\n",
